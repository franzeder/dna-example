                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".845.1/1">With permission, Mr. <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I should like to make a statement on contingency preparations for possible military action against <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".845.1/2">My right hon. Friends the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, and I, have set out the Government's approach to <span class="hi">Iraq</span> on a number of occasions. That approach has not changed in any way. We are committed to the disarmament of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s regime by ensuring its compliance with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> resolution 1441. Our primary objective is to achieve this by peaceful means. Saddam Hussein is being given every opportunity to disarm voluntarily.</p> <p pid=".845.1/3">We hope that he will take this opportunity to do so but, given his previous record, it would be foolish to assume that he will comply unless he faces clear and overwhelming pressure. That is why we must continue to present a credible threat of force.</p> <p pid=".845.1/4">When the House debated this issue on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-25">25 November</phrase>, and when it discussed it again at Defence questions on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-09">9 December</phrase>, I made it clear that we would continue with the prudent preparations and planning necessary for military action, should it be required. I said that we would continue to take appropriate steps to ensure that British forces were ready and had the training, equipment and support that they needed. What we are doing is ensuring that we have a range of military options available, should they be required. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> may, however, find it helpful if I set out again the work that we have put in hand.</p> <p pid=".845.1/5">As I told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-25">25 November</phrase>, we have also been taking action to provide additional capabilities that may potentially be needed, either by bringing forward programmes which were already planned or by making new procurements against short time scales. As the House will recall, these measures include bringing forward the purchase of further temporary deployable accommodation, upgrading the infrastructure available in deployed field hospitals, improving battlefield ambulances, and enhancing the ability of our forces to handle and exploit secure communications. We are approaching the shipping market this week, to charter vessels that might be needed to move equipment and personnel. We are also acting on the lessons learned from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Saif_Sareea">Exercise Saif Sareea</a> 2, particularly in relation to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_2">Challenger 2</a> tank, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS">AS</a> 90 artillery system, and desert clothing and boots. I can assure the House that we are working closely with industry to ensure that British forces will have the capabilities they need for the contingencies that they may face.</p> <p pid=".845.1/6">As I previously indicated to the House, we are also continuing to consider the number and mix of reservists who might be required in the event of military action and to ensure that the machinery and processes involved in mobilising reserves are ready to be used if and when the time comes. Relevant units and individual reservists will be informed of the possibility of being included in a call-out, should that become necessary. We will take steps to identify individuals who may have genuine reasons for not being available in the months ahead. Information will also be made available to reservists for their employers.</p> <p pid=".845.1/7">More generally, I have authorised a range of steps to improve readiness. This includes training, ensuring that the right quantities of equipment are available to those who may need them, as well as the procurement of stocks and spares. For some units it will involve a reduction in their notice to move. This does not mean that they are about to be deployed but that they will be ready to deploy at relatively short notice if required. I emphasise that the involvement of any particular unit in these processes does not mean that it will necessarily take part in any military action that may be required. The purpose of these preparations is to provide the necessary range of options, not a specific plan.</p> <p pid=".845.1/8">We have already announced the long-planned deployment of the naval task group 2003 in the new year, with scheduled visits and exercises in the Gulf and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific">Asia-Pacific</a> regions from February to August. This is a routine deployment that happens approximately every three years but, like all maritime deployments, it remains available for a range of potential operations if required. The group will be led by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal">HMS Ark Royal</a> and will include the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_23">Type 23</a> frigate <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Marlborough">HMS Marlborough</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_42">Type 42</a> destroyer <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Liverpool">HMS Liverpool</a> and support from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Fleet_Auxiliary">Royal Fleet Auxiliary</a> vessels <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Victoria">Fort Victoria</a> and Orangeleaf. A nuclear-powered submarine will also be assigned to the group for part of its deployment. In addition, a mine countermeasures group, comprising HMS Ramsey, HMS Grimsby, HMS Shoreham, HMS Ledbury and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Sir_Bedivere">RFA Sir Bedivere</a> will deploy ahead of the task group to undertake a series of exercises and port visits in the Gulf region.</p> <p pid=".845.1/9">Further to those routine deployments, we are also considering the deployment of additional maritime forces early in the new year to ensure the readiness of a broad range of maritime capabilities, should they be required.</p> <p pid=".845.1/10">Finally, I emphasise once more that these are contingency preparations, aimed at increasing the readiness of a range of options. This process does not lead inexorably to military action. The use of force is not inevitable. However, as long as Saddam's compliance with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCR_1441">UNSCR 1441</a> is in doubt, the threat of force must remain and must be real.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".846.0/1">As the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> is aware, my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=996" title="Our page on Bernard Jenkin - &#39;the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)&#39;">Mr. Jenkin</a>, the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a>, is in the Gulf visiting British servicemen and women who are already there in some force.</p> <p pid=".846.0/2">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement. Indeed, we are grateful to him for responding to the call yesterday from my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1227" title="Our page on Keith Simpson - &#39;the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)&#39;">Mr. Simpson</a> to make a statement today, the last major parliamentary day before Christmas. However, it is an indictment of the Government's priorities that the media were briefed yesterday and the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> was briefed today. We are clearly the poor relations.</p> <p pid=".846.0/3">Furthermore, at the now famous press conference held last month by the Secretary of State and the Chief of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Staff">Defence Staff</a>, the right hon. Gentleman undertook to brief Parliament during our debate on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-25">25 November</phrase>. He failed to do so, imperiously confining himself to a reference to Xprudent preparations and planning". Today's mantra, adding to that, seems to be the mere maintenance of a range of options.</p> <p pid=".846.0/4">It is some time since the Government reported that the United States had submitted a formal request for UK military support. We recognise that operational security may limit the information that the right hon. Gentleman can give the House, so we shall not seek confirmation of every detail published in today's newspapers. However, the House and the country are entitled to know what level of military commitment the Government have in mind. It is frankly bizarre that our television screens are full of US troop manoeuvres in the Gulf while the Government have so far said virtually nothing about possible British involvement.</p> <p pid=".846.0/5">Today's bland statement adds very little to what we know. From reading today's newspapers, it seems that the media know more about the detail than the Secretary of State is prepared to share with the House, so let me put some questions to him. What specific capability has the United States requested, and what is the Government's response? What are the options that he referred to in his statement? Can he assure the House that, bearing in mind reports of shortages, there will be sufficient spares and logistical support to sustain a campaign lasting more than a few days? Has the equipment been desertised and will units trained on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Saif_Sareea">Exercise Saif Sareea</a> be deployed and not held back for firefighting duties?</p> <p pid=".846.0/6">Given the consequences for both reservists and employers, surely the Government could be more specific about their call-up plans. Does the Secretary of State have in mind the call-up of formed units, apart from the medical services? What medication will be prescribed to any British contingent and will it be different from that prescribed during the Gulf war, or take into account United States developments in that respect?</p> <p pid=".846.0/7">Is it not the case that the likely resumption of the firemen's strike will have a damaging limitation on the Secretary of State's ability to deploy troops whose training is up to speed, thus confirming that he is unprepared for the unexpected? Does he accept that publicly preparing British forces for deployment will help to bring pressure to bear on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to comply with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> resolution 1441, and that being more forthcoming would assist the House and the securing of that objective?</p> <p pid=".846.0/8">The statement was thinner than I had expected and than the House was entitled to have heard. I hope that the Secretary of State will confirm that, if there are to be deployments during the Christmas recess, the House will be advised.</p> <p pid=".846.0/9">Finally, as we approach Christmas, I hope that in a spirit of good will and cross-party solidarity the Secretary of State will join me in paying tribute to our armed forces and their families as they stand ready to embark on operations should the need arise.</p></div>

For many years, she has been a champion of the need to observe human rights in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and, indeed, she has not shrunk from the difficult decisions that follow from that. I assure her that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> monitored the conference closely during the weekend, but that conference was clearly a matter for the Iraqi <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> groups themselves.</p> <p pid=".849.1/2">While not attempting to foresee the consequences of military action if it is ultimately required in a place such as <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, I believe that we have an important model in what has taken place in Afghanistan. In the months since military action was necessary there, we have seen a determined effort—not without difficulty; in no way do I underestimate the problems that have been faced—by the international community, by people in Afghanistan and, significantly, by many people returning from exile abroad to Afghanistan to help in the considerable task of rebuilding their country. I have every expectation that the same determined effort will be made by the international community and, indeed, Iraqi exiles in rebuilding their own country.</p></div>

Equally, however, if we did not make prudent preparations, it would be inevitable that we could not take military action should the circumstances warrant it. I simply invite my hon. Friend to consider that. If he believes, as I am sure he does, in the need to enforce UN resolutions, he must also believe that it is necessary to take military action in certain circumstances to uphold those decisions. As for chartering ships, it is important that the UK has available to it a secure and reliable system of being able to transport both its people and its equipment.</p></div>
