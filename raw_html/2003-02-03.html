                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".21.1/1">May I first tell the House that I have sent messages of condolence to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> and <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> Sharon following the break-up of the Columbia space shuttle on Saturday? This was a tragedy not just for the seven astronauts and their families, but for their countries and all who value space exploration. I am sure that the whole House would want to join me in expressing our sadness and our sympathy.</p> <p pid=".21.1/2">With permission, Mr. <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I shall make a statement on my visit to Washington.</p> <p pid=".21.1/3">In addition to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, which I shall come to in a moment, President Bush and I discussed the middle east peace process, Afghanistan and global poverty and development. On the first, we agreed on the vital necessity of making progress based on the twin-state solution: Israel confident of its own security and a Palestinian state that is viable. I am convinced there is now a real wish across the world to push this process forward and I hope that we can take further steps on this issue soon. I believe it is of fundamental importance, not just to peace in the middle east, but to peace throughout the world.</p> <p pid=".21.1/4">But the immediate focus of the visit was <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Over the past week, in addition to meeting President Bush, I have seen Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> Aznar, President Mbeki, Prime Minister Berlusconi and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Saud">Prince Saud</a>. Today, I have spoken to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Chirac">President Chirac</a>. After this statement, I will be speaking to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Putin">President Putin</a>, and I have also spoken to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers">Prime Ministers</a> of Turkey, Canada, Greece, Poland, Portugal and Australia. I shall meet President Chirac tomorrow. In addition, my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> is in regular contact with his opposite numbers from countries on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>, in the European Union and in the middle east, and will be in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> for UN meetings later this week.</p> <p pid=".21.1/5">We are entering the final phase of a 12-year history of the disarmament of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. The duty on Saddam to destroy all his weapons of mass destruction was a central part of the ceasefire agreement at the end of the Gulf war in 1991. In a series of 17 resolutions since then, the UN Security Council has put Saddam under 27 separate and categorical obligations to give full, final and complete declarations on its weapons programmes; to give inspectors unconditional and unrestricted access; to cease the concealment of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> weapons of mass destruction; and to co-operate fully with the inspectors in the disarmament of all <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> weapons of mass destruction. Saddam has consistently flouted these obligations. That is why a sanctions regime has been in place for years against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> which, because of the way in which Saddam has applied it, has caused wholly unnecessary suffering for the Iraqi people.</p> <p pid=".21.1/6">Last November, the UN Security Council concluded unanimously that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was still, and I quote, "in material breach of UN resolutions." Saddam was given "a final opportunity" to comply with his disarmament obligations. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_1441">Resolution 1441</a> imposed on Saddam a duty to give</p> <p class="indent" pid=".21.1/7">"a currently accurate, full and complete declaration of all aspects of its programmes to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and other delivery systems"; to provide</p> <p class="indent" pid=".21.1/9">"immediate, unimpeded, unrestricted and private access" to all people the inspectors wish to interview,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".21.1/11">"in the mode or location" of the inspectors' choice; and also to co-operate actively and fully with all the inspectors' demands. Failure by <span class="hi">Iraq</span> at any time to comply with and co-operate fully in the implementation of the resolution was said in terms to constitute a further material breach.</p> <p pid=".21.1/13">Eight weeks have now passed since Saddam was given his final chance. Six hundred weeks have passed since he was given his first chance. The evidence of co-operation withheld is unmistakable. Saddam has still not answered the questions concerning thousands of missing munitions and tons of chemical and biological agents unaccounted for. Rocket warheads with chemical weapons capacity have been found by the inspectors: they should have been declared. Classified documents of relevance to <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> past nuclear programme have been discovered in a scientist's private house: they should have been handed over. Of the first 11 documents specifically requested by the inspectors, only three have been produced. Not a single interviewee has come to an appointment with the inspectors without their so-called official minders.</p> <p pid=".21.1/14">As the report we published at the weekend makes clear, and which I <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=252" title="This phrase is often used in written answers to indicate that a minister..." class="glossary">placed in the Library</a> of the House, there is a huge infrastructure of deception and concealment designed to prevent the inspectors from doing their job. US <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a> will report further to the UN on this on Wednesday. As Dr. Blix, the UN Chief Inspector, reported last week:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".21.1/15">"<span class="hi">Iraq</span> appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today—of the disarmament which was demanded of it."</p> <p pid=".21.1/16">He said that <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> declaration seemed to contain no new evidence; that there are indications that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has weaponised the nerve agent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a>, one of the most toxic ever developed; that there are strong indications that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> produced more anthrax than it has declared; and that the discovery of chemical rocket warheads could be, again I quote, "the tip of an iceberg".</p> <p pid=".21.1/17">The situation therefore could not be clearer. There is a duty on Saddam to co-operate fully. At present, he is not co-operating fully. Failure to do so is a material breach of resolution 1441. Should Dr. Blix continue to report Iraqi non-co-operation, a second resolution should be passed confirming such a material breach. President Bush and I agreed that we should seek maximum support for such a resolution, provided, as ever, that seeking such a resolution is a way of resolving the issue, not delaying or avoiding dealing with it at all. I continue to believe that the United Nations is the right way to proceed. There is integrity in the process set out in resolution 1441 and we should follow it.</p> <p pid=".21.1/18">We of course discussed the fact that weapons of mass destruction are not the only threat the world faces, and <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is not the only country posing a risk in respect of weapons of mass destruction. Over the past few weeks, we have seen powerful evidence of the continuing terrorist threat: the suspected ricin plot in London and Manchester; al-Qaeda experiments in Afghanistan to develop chemical, biological and radiological weapons; the arrests of those linked to al-Qaeda in Spain and France; and further arrests just a few days ago in Italy. What is more, many of these arrests show the terrorist groups actively seeking to use chemical or biological means to cause as much death and injury and suffering as they can. We know too from <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> that these terrorists have no demands that could ever be negotiated upon, no constraint in terms of finance and numbers to carry out terrorist acts, and no compunction in taking human life.</p> <p pid=".21.1/19">At the same time, we know that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is not alone in developing weapons of mass destruction; there are unstable, fiercely repressive states either proliferating or trying to acquire <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD">WMD</a>, like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a>. I repeat my warning: unless we take a decisive stand now as an international community, it is only a matter of time before these threats come together. That means pursuing international terrorism across the world in all its forms. It means confronting nations defying the world over weapons of mass destruction. That is why a signal of weakness over <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is not only wrong in its own terms. Show weakness now and no one will ever believe us when we try to show strength in future. All our history, especially British history, points to this lesson. No one wants conflict. Even now, war could be avoided if Saddam did what he is supposed to do. But if, having made a demand backed up by a threat of force, we fail to enforce that demand, the result will not be peace or security. It will simply be returning to confront the issue again at a later time, with the world less stable, the will of the international community less certain, and those repressive states or terrorist groups that would destroy our way of life emboldened and undeterred.</p> <p pid=".21.1/20">Even now, I hope that conflict with <span class="hi">Iraq</span> can be avoided. Even now, I hope that Saddam can come to his senses, co-operate fully and disarm peacefully, as the UN has demanded. But if he does not—if he rejects the peaceful route—he must be disarmed by force. If we have to go down that route, we shall do all we can to minimise the risks to the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, and we give an absolute undertaking to protect <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> territorial integrity. Our quarrel has never been with the Iraqi people, but with Saddam.</p> <p pid=".21.1/21">Saddam's weapons of mass destruction and the threats that they pose to the world must be confronted. In doing so, this country and our armed forces will be helping the long-term peace and security of Britain and the world.</p></div>

Last week the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was already in breach. Does the Prime Minister share his Foreign Secretary's opinion that Saddam is in breach now? Dr. Blix's main concern was that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is not actively co-operating with the weapons inspectors. Does the Prime Minister agree that it is clear from the resolutions that it is not, as some continue to say, for the inspectors to find the weapons; it is for <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to account for discrepancies in her weapons declaration and to co-operate fully with the inspectors?</p> <p pid=".23.0/4">Secretary <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a> will this week reveal US intelligence that will outline the dangers that Saddam Hussein poses to the United States—in particular, how weapons inspectors have been deceived. Many British people, we know, are still anxious about the possible use of military force, and they are entitled, of course, to as much information as possible. Will the Prime Minister publish not only Colin Powell's presentation, but the Government's assessment of that new information? Notwithstanding the information that Downing street published over the weekend, will he also make available any further intelligence especially relevant to the security of the United Kingdom or its citizens? Will his entire <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> take that information to the British people to make the case?</p> <p pid=".23.0/5">We welcome the letter sent by eight European leaders in support of resolution 1441. Can the Prime Minister confirm reports that France and Germany were not asked to sign it? What reaction has he had from the leaders of France and Germany to the letter? The Prime Minister meets <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Chirac">President Chirac</a> tomorrow. Will he remind the President that he was a signatory of 1441, which warns unequivocally that "serious consequences" will follow any violation of the resolution? And after that letter, what assessment has the Prime Minister made of the circumstances under which France would support a second resolution?</p> <p pid=".23.0/6">Does the Prime Minister agree that taking a tough stance on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has already yielded results? It has focused the United Nations on taking action to tackle the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>; it has secured the entry of inspectors; and it has brought Saddam Hussein under pressure to comply with his international obligations.</p> <p pid=".23.0/7">Does the right hon. Gentleman also agree that, if and when a second resolution is secured, those who have to date opposed action to disarm Saddam Hussein have a stark choice? They can either back that second resolution, and any military action that follows, or have the courage to admit that they are opposed to military action in any circumstances.</p> <p pid=".23.0/8">Saddam Hussein's day of reckoning is fast approaching. Peace or war—the choice is his. Disarm, or face the consequences.</p></div>

I think that we are in agreement on the main issues.</p> <p pid=".24.0/2">With regard to the middle east peace process, I am now more hopeful than I have been for some time that in the medium term we can make progress. I had a very good and constructive set of talks with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> on that issue.</p> <p pid=".24.0/3">I agree entirely with what the right hon. Gentleman says about resolution 1441. We shall, I am sure, make available <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a>'s presentation on Wednesday and our assessment of it.</p> <p pid=".24.0/4">We issued further intelligence over the weekend about the infrastructure of concealment. It is obviously difficult when we publish intelligence reports, but I hope that people have some sense of the integrity of our security services. They are not publishing this, or giving us this information, and making it up. It is the intelligence that they are receiving, and we are passing it on to people. In the dossier that we published last year, and again in the material that we put out over the weekend, it is very clear that a vast amount of concealment and deception is going on.</p> <p pid=".24.0/5">Obviously there are different positions in Europe. But people can come round behind the UN process, because resolution 1441, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly points out, was passed by a unanimous Security Council. The integrity of that process is very clear. There is a duty fully to comply. If <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is not fully complying, having been given a final opportunity, a fresh resolution should issue. There is an inexorable logic to that, which will in the end bring people round. If we can do this and manage it through the international community, that will be a huge boost not just for dealing with the threat of weapons of mass destruction, but also for the integrity of the UN.</p></div>

Friends, in extending our sincere sympathy over all those who were lost as a result of the terrible tragedy in the United States at the weekend. We hope that their families are aware of the heartfelt sense of sympathy that exists internationally.</p> <p pid=".25.0/2">With regard to the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s statement this afternoon, he is well aware, as we all are in the House, of the extent of public anxiety about the development of events. In particular, an awful lot of people right across the political spectrum and otherwise have a sense that we seem to be hastening into war ahead of events. Will the Prime Minister recognise that over the whole developing history of this matter, going right back to the recall of Parliament last September and the publication of the security services' dossier then, the Government have from time to time been perceived to be issuing mixed messages, not least in recent weeks from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Secretary">Defence Secretary</a>? That needs to be said, because that is what people in the country feel.</p> <p pid=".25.0/3">The Government have still to make a credible case. That case, for any fair-minded person viewing it, has to be based on credible evidence, which has not so far been forthcoming.</p> <p pid=".25.0/4">Would the Prime Minister also acknowledge that the weapons inspectors need time to complete their task; that this Government must, if push comes to shove, be seen to subscribe, as he rightly acknowledged in his statement, to the United Nations route; and that if the Americans decide to take some form of pre-emptive action ahead of the weapons inspectors being able to complete their task, this country will have to be clear cut as to where its sense of allegiance lies? Does it lie with the United Nations route that the Government have rightly prosecuted with full support across all parties in the House, or will it lie with the United States?</p> <p pid=".25.0/5">The weapons inspectors are searching for that evidence on behalf of the United Nations and the entire international community. Does the Prime Minister recognise, given his statements over the weekend, that making it appear that war is somehow now inevitable makes it hard for the public to believe that the President of the United States and he are objective about the task in front of the weapons inspectors? If <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a> produces on Wednesday this week the hard evidence—the so-called smoking gun—that convinces the Security Council of the need for war, will that not prompt another question? If such evidence is concrete, clear cut and so persuasive, why was it not put in the hands of the weapons inspectors sooner rather than later? Did the Prime Minister express that opinion in his discussions with the President of the United States over the weekend? If not, why not? If the weapons inspectors come back and in due course say that they need more time and request that time, will Britain actively and publicly speak up in their support; or if the Americans decide to take pre-emptive actions come what may, will we side with the United States?</p> <p pid=".25.0/6">Finally, did the Prime Minister clarify with the President, and can he now clarify with this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> and the country, the exact command and control structure for the forces that are now being deployed in our name on behalf of Britain in that region?</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".26.0/1">First of all, I think that the right hon. Gentleman said that we were hastening into war ahead of events. We have gone through 12 years of this process—12 years in which we have tried to get Saddam to disarm. We then came together last November and passed a resolution saying that there should be one final opportunity. That is hardly hastening into a war. If he does not comply with that UN resolution—he is not complying at the moment—we are not hastening into it ahead of events, but responding to the fact that Saddam has refused point blank, as he has done throughout 12 years, to do what the United Nations has asked him to do.</p> <p pid=".26.0/2">As for saying that credible evidence has not been forthcoming that Saddam is in breach of the resolution, the resolution says that he must make a full and honest declaration. I simply ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he thinks that a declaration that does not even disclose what has happened to the thousands of munitions and tonnes of nerve, chemical and biological agents that we know were left over from 1999 is full and honest. Does he really believe that a failure even to declare what has happened to that is an honest undertaking and declaration of what has happened? Does he think that the refusal to allow Iraqi experts to be interviewed—a vital part of the inspection process—unless they come with so-called Iraqi minders is acceptable? None of us can be so naive as to think that such people are present merely to offer the odd cup of coffee and comfort.</p> <p pid=".26.0/3">If Saddam is carrying on in breach of those obligations, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> himself says that he is, that is the credible evidence that he is not co-operating. With the greatest respect, the right hon. Gentleman seems to suggest, when he says that we are not objective, that somehow it is for us to come along and prove that Saddam is a guilty party. No; the United Nations decided that he was in breach of the UN resolutions and he has got to produce the evidence that he is now co-operating fully— and he is not doing so.</p> <p pid=".26.0/4">Now that is not simply our view—it is the view of Dr. Blix and the UN weapons inspectors. The right hon. Gentleman says that they should have time to complete their task. Yes, they should, but their task is not to engage in an elaborate game of hide and seek with Saddam whereby the UN inspectors go in and try to find the stuff while he tries to hide it—if they find it, they win; if he hides it, he wins. That is not how the system is supposed to operate. That was how it operated in the 1990s, however, so that a weapons inspections process that was supposed to take weeks ended up taking years. This time, therefore, the resolution—1441—said, "You've got a final opportunity; you've got to make an honest declaration; you've got to co-operate fully with the inspectors." The time that they need, and the time that we need within the United Nations, is the time to make a judgment on whether that co-operation is forthcoming. At present, it is not. All we are saying is that if that does not change, Saddam is continuing to play the game that he has been playing for 12 years, which is unacceptable. That is not a sign of our failing to be objective, but a sign of our failing to be weak in the face of a threat that is posed to us in the world community.</p> <p pid=".26.0/5">Finally, I simply say this to the right hon. Gentleman. I know, of course, that there is huge anxiety, and that many criticisms are made of the United States, but it would be quite wrong if we used this issue to try to polarise the United States and the international community. The United States chose to go through the UN process last November, when many people thought that it would not. It was right to do so, and we should carry on through the UN process, but that process should be a way of dealing with this issue once and for all, not of kicking it into the long grass again and avoiding it altogether.</p></div>

Friend about <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> recovery and reconstruction in the event of Saddam forcing war? In addition to the need for political transition, the humanitarian and refugee demands could be immense. Will he outline to the House what preparation is being made for that at the United Nations and by key members of the international community? What structure for reconstruction is being put in place? In terms of donor funding, will Britain join America—and, I think, Switzerland and Canada—in making an early offer of resources for those purposes?</p></div>

It is up to him whether he wishes to travel in a specific way or interview specific people. However, the hon. Gentleman's basic point is right. I recommend people to read resolution 1441 again. It could not be clearer. Any demand by the UN inspectors must be acceded to. That is not happening. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, many issues to do with surveillance, interviewing witnesses and unaccounted for material need to be resolved. There is little sign of matters changing. Dr. Blix said that there was no point in continuing unless the inspectors are given the full access that they need and all their demands are met. I agree with that.</p></div>

Friend's first point, I do not know what other countries' attitude will be, but I am working on the basis that people hold to both the spirit and the letter of resolution 1441.

The logic of that will take people along with us, especially when there are further inspectors' reports to come.</p></div>

If their task is to return to what happened in the 1990s, when they stayed there for long periods of time and tried to work their way around Iraqi obstruction, it could take them years to complete it. If, however, their task is to go in there on the basis that Saddam is going fully to co-operate, it will be complete when they make their judgment either that he is doing so—in which case, they can get on and close the matériel down—or that he is not, in which case they do not need to wait months or years. That would be the situation in which, in the words of resolution 1441, there would be a further material breach, because Saddam would not have taken the final opportunity to disarm.</p> <p pid=".29.5/2">I must point out to my hon. Friend that Saddam cannot be in any doubt as to what he has to do. It is not a great mystery. I am told that he is calling for all sorts of people to come and visit him and talk to him, but there is no mystery about what he has to do. There is a perfectly well-trodden path in relation to UN inspectors, and it involves making a full declaration. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a> followed it when it closed down its nuclear weapons programme after the change of regime and the end of apartheid. It called in the inspectors, told them exactly what it had, and allowed them full access to all its witnesses. The whole thing was then shut down in a matter of weeks. That is what can happen. The initial stages of it happened immensely quickly, and it could happen again. If the UN inspectors were saying to us, "Yes, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is doing absolutely everything it can", I would not be standing here making this statement. I am making it not because we are being led by the nose into conflict, but because we have set out a process governed by that UN resolution. That process requires full compliance by Saddam, and he is not fully complying.</p></div>

The hon. Gentleman is right to say that, approached in the wrong way, this could lead to misunderstandings—for example, that this is an attack on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> because it is a Muslim country, and all the rest of the propaganda that surrounds these issues. I believe that there is now a clearer understanding—I have certainly found this in my discussions with Arab Heads of State—that this is about enforcing the will of the UN. Done in the right way, and with the right guarantees to the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, the whole process of disarmament could be seen as a victory not only for the international community, but for the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. I must point out that the consequence of not having disarmed Saddam properly, and of allowing the will of the UN to be flouted over many years, is that we have had to put in place a very tough, punitive sanctions regime. Because of the way in which Saddam has operated it—he need not have done it in the way that he has—it has caused the most terrible misery to the people in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. More than half the population is dependent on the oil-for-food programme.</p> <p pid=".31.0/2">I think that in the end people, not least in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, will realise not just that seeing the back of Saddam is good for the peace and security of the world, but that the first beneficiaries will be the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p></div>

This is not an issue that has popped up in the last few months; it is an issue that we have been living with for 12 years.</p> <p pid=".32.1/3">Let me also point out to the House and the country that every single day about 2,000 British armed forces personnel are engaged in trying to patrol the no-fly zones, and in other activity associated with the whole problem to do with <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Although this is in the headlines now, it has been there for a long time. The reason why there is a certain impatience is that we must not go back and allow the UN to be used as a way of tricking people into parking the issue and not dealing with it.

I remember that people said something similar to us when Afghanistan came about. It depends on the circumstances. If we are taking action where we are obviously and clearly enforcing the will of the UN, his view is not right. There is a growing recognition that Saddam is not someone we should be defending. What I have said constantly to people over this issue is that the people who will be most delighted to see the end of Saddam are the people who are his first and primary victims—his own people. In those circumstances, I do not believe that it will recruit people to the cause of terrorism, but I say to the hon. Gentleman honestly that what will recruit people to the cause of terrorism is a belief among these fanatics that the will of the international community is weak, that it does not have the determination to confront these issues, and that, when faced with the challenge, we fail to meet it.</p></div>

There has been quite a lot of progress out of that meeting. I entirely agree with what the hon. Gentleman says. Incidentally, I also believe—I will choose my words carefully—that the absence of a sense of real progress on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel-Palestine">Israel-Palestine</a> issue is a far bigger worry in terms of recruiting people to terrorism than is the pursuit of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> over weapons of mass destruction. That is why it is important that we deal with this. I also think that one of the benefits of what has happened in the past few months is that there is consensus internationally on the two-state solution. That is a huge step forward. Everyone now agrees that Israel needs to be recognised by all its neighbours, confident about its own security, and that any Palestinian state must be viable. That is an issue that will be pushed forward, I hope soon.</p></div>

Last summer, there was a certain amount of scepticism as to whether we would achieve the first UN resolution and we did; in the end, we achieved it unanimously. I entirely understand the hesitation and anxiety that have been expressed not just in this country but in other countries. Of course, people do not want us to engage in conflict if we can possibly avoid it. However, what is important is that if it is the case that UN inspectors continue to certify that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is not fully co-operating, there is a logic in that that will bring everyone—I hope everyone—on board. Otherwise, the whole authority of the UN, which we all agree should be upheld, would be undermined.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".35.0/1">That is a very good point and a fair one, and in many ways it is the difficultly that we have with this issue. I believe that <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> was a wake-up call to the world. It was an extremely important moment when something happened that we thought could never possibly happen: modern technology and terrorist fanaticism came together in the most devastating way for the people of the United States and for the world. What is interesting is that at our press conference on Friday, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> made the point that a few days before <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> he was discussing how we ameliorated the sanctions regime against <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".35.0/2">It is true that <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> has changed a lot of thinking. That is why, a few days afterwards—on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-14">14 September</phrase>—I made my first statement on the matter to the House, in which I said that the next issue that we had to deal with was weapons of mass destruction. We have constantly tried to explain to people that these two issues are not separate. People say to us, "Why don't you pursue al-Qaeda and forget about <span class="hi">Iraq</span> for the moment?", but we have got to go on both tracks because both represent the threats of the fanatical over the rational. They represent threats to the civilised world from acts of barbarity, and both represent those people who have absolutely no compunction whatever about the amount of human life that they take, for a cause that can never be negotiated on.</p> <p pid=".35.0/3">So the fact is that these two issues are intimately linked. People talk about the potential links between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and al-Qaeda—there is a lot of speculation—but without a doubt, if we do not deal with both of these issues at some point terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will come together. It is simply not possible to have a situation in which states are developing and trading in this stuff, with their scientists being hired by the top bidder, and in which these terrorist groups are well-financed and able to recruit people even to die in their cause. It is not possible to have those two threats operating and for them not to come together at a certain point, and the consequences would then be devastating.</p> <p pid=".35.0/4">People ask me why I am, in a sense, risking everything politically on this issue, but I say to them in all honesty that I do not want to be the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> to whom people point the finger in history and say, "You knew perfectly well that those two threats were there, and you didn't do anything about it. In the end, you took the easy way out. You said, 'No, let's park it a little. Let's leave it—let's wait and see how it goes.'" We know that these threats are there and we have got to deal with them. I think that, in the end, in situations such as this the British people always ultimately respond, because they have a common sense and a faith that sees them through.</p></div>
