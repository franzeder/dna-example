                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".431.1/1">With permission, Mr. <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I should like to make a statement about negotiations on a new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> resolution in respect of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".431.1/2">A revised draft resolution was circulated to all members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> yesterday. The council is now discussing the text and will vote on it shortly. A vote could come as early as tomorrow night. As we will prorogue later today, I wanted to update the House now as the negotiations are entering their final stage. I have placed a copy of the joint United Kingdom-United States draft in the Libraries of both Houses.</p> <p pid=".431.1/3">As my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> reminded the House yesterday, our overriding objective is to disarm <span class="hi">Iraq</span> of its weapons of mass destruction through an effective inspections regime. The Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and I have made the case for UN action here in the House, to our allies and to the wider world. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-10">10 September</phrase>, my right hon. Friend told the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trades_Union_Congress">Trades Union Congress</a> conference that the UN had to be the means of dealing with this problem, not of avoiding it. Two days later, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>, in his historic speech to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly">General Assembly</a>, said that the UN had either to enforce the writ of its own resolutions or risk becoming irrelevant. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-14">14 September</phrase>, in the same forum, I called on the UN to meet the challenge posed by <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and to defend its own authority.</p> <p pid=".431.1/4">As one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, the UK has been determined to ensure that the UN emerges from this crisis with its credibility enhanced. During the negotiations, our aim has been to secure consensus on a tough resolution that leaves <span class="hi">Iraq</span> under no illusions about the need for disarmament. The text currently before the Security Council is the product of eight weeks of intensive negotiations. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> and the United States began to circulate elements of a draft resolution to fellow Security Council members on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-25">25 September</phrase>, and a draft full text on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-23">23 October</phrase>.</p> <p pid=".431.1/5">Throughout these two months, my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a> has spoken to President Bush and other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heads_of_Government">Heads of Government</a> at regular intervals. I have been in daily contact with the US <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a>, and I have had detailed discussions on numerous occasions with my French, Russian and Chinese counterparts and with Foreign Ministers of the elected 10 of the Security Council. Our UN ambassador, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Jeremy_Greenstock">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</a>, and his team have worked tirelessly in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a>.</p> <p pid=".431.1/6">The draft resolution uses the full powers of the UN under chapter 7 of its charter. The architecture of the draft has been extensively discussed between the permanent members, and I would like now to set out for the House the key points.</p> <p pid=".431.1/7">First, the text makes it clear in operative paragraph <span class="hi">1</span> that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under previous Security Council resolutions. Secondly, in operative paragraph 2, the text affords <span class="hi">Iraq</span> a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations. Thirdly, it stipulates that false statements or omissions in <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> declaration of its weapons of mass destruction holdings and failure by <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to comply with the resolution shall constitute a further material breach of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> obligations, and provides that this will be reported to the council for assessment. Fourthly, the text gives significantly enhanced powers to the United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> to conduct effective, intrusive inspections.</p> <p pid=".431.1/8">Right hon. and hon. Members may be surprised by the level of detail in the resolution, but our experience with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> has made that necessary. I draw particular attention to the following aspects of the resolution: the provision for conducting interviews with Iraqi citizens inside or outside <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, without the presence of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Government">Iraqi Government</a> minders; the explicit setting aside of previous arrangements that restricted inspectors' access to so-called presidential sites; provisions for freezing a site to be inspected so that nothing is changed within it nor taken from it while it is being inspected; and making legally binding the Xpractical arrangements" set out by the inspectors themselves and covering issues such as regional bases, the right to encrypted communications, and so on. In sum, it is a basis for an inspection regime designed not to go through the motions, but to achieve disarmament.</p> <p pid=".431.1/9">The text sets out the procedure to be followed in the case of failure by <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to comply: it requires in operative paragraph 4 that any further material breach of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> obligations should be reported to the Security Council. It directs in operative paragraph 11 the executive chairman of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a> and the director general of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAEA">IAEA</a> to report immediately to the council any interference by <span class="hi">Iraq</span> with their inspection activities or failure to comply with its disarmament obligations. It provides in operative paragraph 12 that the council will convene immediately on receipt of a report of non-compliance in order to consider the situation.</p> <p pid=".431.1/10">On timing, the text provides that within seven days of adoption of the resolution <span class="hi">Iraq</span> must confirm its intention fully to comply; that within 30 days <span class="hi">Iraq</span> must submit a full and accurate declaration of all aspects of its <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD">WMD</a> programmes; that within 45 days inspections should resume; and that within 105 days of the passing of the resolution UNMOVIC and IAEA should report to the Security Council. The text concludes by underlining that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has been repeatedly warned that it will face serious consequences as a result of continuous violations of its obligations.</p> <p pid=".431.1/11">I emphasise again that the detailed wording may change further in negotiation; discussions will resume this afternoon in New York. However, this draft resolution meets the United Kingdom's objectives. It takes into account many points raised in the Security Council by other member states and by the chief inspectors, Mr. Blix and Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Baradei">El Baradei</a>. We are now seeking unanimous support for the resolution in order to send the strongest message to Saddam Hussein.</p> <p pid=".431.1/12">Britain wants a peaceful resolution to this crisis, and the United States has shown by its engagement in the long negotiations over past weeks that it too is committed to using the UN route in order to resolve this problem. At this point, I should like to pay my own tribute to President Bush and to United States <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> Powell for their great patience and great statesmanship.</p> <p pid=".431.1/13">History tells us that if diplomacy is to succeed it must be combined with the credible threat of force. As <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> has said, with direct reference to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".431.1/14">XWe have learned that sensitive diplomacy must be backed by the threat of military force if it is to succeed."</p> <p pid=".431.1/15">It is that threat which, in recent weeks, has forced Saddam to concede the prospect of readmitting weapons inspectors. The more credible the threat, the more likely it is that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will respond to the demands of the UN.</p> <p pid=".431.1/16">As the negotiations at the Security Council enter their final stage, we are approaching a critical moment for the whole of the international community and for the integrity of our system of international law. By adopting the resolution, the Security Council will send the clearest possible signal of its determination to uphold the authority of the United Nations, and we will be one step closer to resolving a problem that has undermined the security of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> neighbours, and the wider world, for more than a decade. The task of the inspectors is to find and to destroy the weapons of mass destruction. The choice for Saddam Hussein is to comply with the UN or face the serious consequences.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".433.0/1">I thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> for his statement and for giving me sight of it in advance.</p> <p pid=".433.0/2">We congratulate the United States and United Kingdom Governments on the resolution, and I recognise the Foreign Secretary's contribution to it. We hope it will secure the support of the Security Council and not be vetoed by any permanent member. This is a test of the determination of the United Nations to deal with the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of unstable, undemocratic, despotic and aggressive regimes. If the resolution were to fall because of the veto of permanent members with political or commercial interests in so vetoing it, the integrity of the United Nations would be seriously damaged.</p> <p pid=".433.0/3">The resolution sets out clearly the requirements that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> must fulfil if he is to rectify what the resolution describes as the</p> <p class="indent" pid=".433.0/4">Xmaterial breach of its obligations under relevant Resolutions".</p> <p pid=".433.0/5">Those resolutions, which together would achieve the central objective of the elimination of his weapons of mass destruction, are already in place. The resolution stipulates the timetables within which the various requirements must be met and rightly indicates serious consequences for non-compliance. We also strongly welcome the commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".433.0/6">Does the Foreign Secretary agree that the resolution must leave no room for doubt or manoeuvring in the mind of Saddam Hussein? There are a number of matters on which the resolution could be still clearer, which I hope he will clarify. Do the words in paragraph 2—</p> <p class="indent" pid=".433.0/7">Xa final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations"— mean that in the event of non-compliance no further resolutions will required before appropriate action can be taken? Is it implicit in the resolution that action is already justified by the existing and continuing material breach of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> obligations? What happens if, after seven days, Saddam Hussein has not unambiguously confirmed his intention to comply with the resolution? That does not seem to be covered in paragraph 12.</p> <p pid=".433.0/9">Who judges under paragraph <span class="hi">3</span> whether any disclosure of weapons and missiles is full and final given that previous disclosures by <span class="hi">Iraq</span> have subsequently been admitted to have been inaccurate? What account has been taken of the use of the past eight weeks by Saddam Hussein to hide his weapons of mass destruction, which was alluded to in the dossier published in September, and what measures are being taken to counter that? What happens if, after the 105 days to which the Foreign Secretary referred in paragraph 5, no weapons of mass destruction have been found but there remain indications that they exist?</p> <p pid=".433.0/10">Will the Foreign Secretary confirm that the reference in paragraph 12 to restoring Xinternational peace and security" must be read in conjunction with article 42 of chapter <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VII">VII</a> of the United Nations charter, which states:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".433.0/11">Xaction can be taken by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to . . . restore international peace and security"?</p> <p pid=".433.0/12">What will the Government do if the resolution is vetoed? What preparations is the right hon. Gentleman making to have a full debate on the subject in Government time when the House returns?</p> <p pid=".433.0/13">The message of resolution and, I hope, the message of the House to Saddam Hussein must quite simply be:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".433.0/14">XYour weapons of mass destruction must go. You can do it yourself or it will be done for you."</p></div>

Gentleman for his generosity in what he said about the work done in the United States and here, including by me?</p> <p pid=".434.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman asked about a veto. We are not anticipating a veto of the resolution, and I do not want to anticipate that. Nothing is certain until the matter is put to a vote, but we have worked hard over the past eight weeks to bring our colleagues in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5">P5</a> and the elected 10 to a clear consensus not on a mushy resolution, but on a clear-cut resolution that sets out the clearest possible obligations on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. Every Foreign <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to whom I have spoken in the past eight weeks agrees that the best chance of resolving Saddam Hussein's defiance of the international community lies in the international community showing the greatest degree of unanimity—and toughness.</p> <p pid=".434.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman asks a series of questions about the Xfinal opportunity" mentioned in operative paragraph 2. The draft resolution is structured to tell Saddam Hussein, in operative paragraph 1, that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".434.0/4">XIraq has been and remains in material breach"; operative paragraph 2 states that this is Xa final opportunity"; operative paragraphs <span class="hi">3</span> to 10 set out how <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has to fulfil what is described euphemistically as an</p> <p class="indent" pid=".434.0/6">Xopportunity to comply with its . . . obligations"; under operative paragraph 11, the inspectors are under a duty to report to the Security Council if they come across any breach; and under operative paragraphs 4 and 11, the Security Council can—and will—resume its meetings to consider the circumstances if there is a breach.</p> <p pid=".434.0/8">I do not want to anticipate what will happen if there is a breach, except to say that although we would much prefer decisions to be taken within the Security Council, we have always made it clear that within international law we have to reserve our right to take military action, if that is required, within the existing charter and the existing body of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> resolutions, if, for example, a subsequent resolution were to be vetoed. However, I do not believe that it will come to that.</p> <p pid=".434.0/9">The right hon. Gentleman asks about the 105 days. There is a clear requirement on the inspectors to report within 105 days, but that, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Jeremy_Greenstock">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</a> made clear yesterday, does not mean that the inspections end when the 105 days have elapsed.</p> <p pid=".434.0/10">The right hon. Gentleman asks about article 42 of the UN charter. The whole resolution, if it is passed, has to be read against the background of the UN charter.</p> <p pid=".434.0/11">Finally, the right hon. Gentleman asks whether I am making arrangements for a full debate in Government time. The answer is yes, and we hope that it will be on a substantive motion.</p></div>

Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that those who oppose military action should recognise that the risks of doing nothing in these circumstances probably outweigh the risks of doing something? However, there are risks involved in military action of exacerbating the terrorist threat that we face. It seems to me that there are two things that we could do to reduce that threat. One is to put renewed efforts behind getting a solution to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab-Israeli">Arab-Israeli</a> conflict. I realise that Israeli politics make that difficult but we need to be seen to be doing more.

The resolution is good news but I emphasise that it has not yet been passed. I am making a statement today rather than after the Security Council resolution has been passed because the House will be prorogued and there will not be another opportunity this Session.</p> <p pid=".436.5/2">As for military action, we are working on the basis that the resolution will prove effective. I have always said that the best chance of a peaceful solution to the crisis is through unanimity of the international community and a clear and credible threat of force if there is not compliance. Of course we must plan for the possibility of military action, but I remain quite optimistic that if we get unanimity, or near unanimity, the process can work. I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need to push forward with the middle east peace process.</p></div>

False statements or omissions or failure to comply, as set out in operative paragraph 4, will amount to a material breach, and any reporting by the inspectors may turn out to show a material breach. Then, under operative paragraph 12, the Security Council will meet to discuss the matter. Any member of the Security Council can table a resolution, and it remains to be seen whether the Security Council or individual members judge that a further resolution is necessary to deal with the material breach that is presented to them.

I cannot predict those circumstances; moreover, I do not particularly want to, because what I want to see is a peaceful resolution of the crisis. The best way of getting such a peaceful resolution is, yes, by threatening force—we have to, because of the nature of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>—but also by backing that threat of force with a credible effective weapons inspection regime of the kind laid down in the draft resolution.

Friend takes that view, and I have to say that I profoundly disagree with everything she has said. The very intensive discussions that I have been involved in over the past eight weeks with Foreign Ministers and Governments—those of Mauritius, Cameroon, Ireland, Syria, Mexico, Norway, Bulgaria, Singapore, Colombia and Guinea, as well as those of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation">Russian Federation</a>, France, China and the United States—are not discussions between people who are not equal. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5">P5</a> and the elected 10 are all equals, because we have a similar vote within the Security Council. It strains credibility to suggest that if there is, as I hope there will be, a 14:<span class="hi">1</span> or 15:0 vote on the resolution, it has come about only because of bullying. That is not the case. The reason why it has come about—or rather, will have come about, if it does—and the reason why there is now a great emerging consensus, is that everybody in the civilised world recognises that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> has been in the most terrible breach of international obligations under Security Council resolutions, and that the time has come to require that awful, terrible regime to put right those breaches of obligations. Sadly, we have to do so by threatening force, but backing it in this way with such an inspection system. There are no trip wires in the resolution; we have been extremely careful to ensure that there is none. For example, it gives realistic time scales. If he wishes, Saddam Hussein can comply with every dot and comma of it. It is what it says it is: a final opportunity.</p></div>

We work on the basis that this man is a liar and a cheat. We spent a long time drafting the resolution to ensure that it covers every possibility that we can conceive of; and that is why, annexed to the resolution but being made into Security Council law, is a very detailed letter from Mr. Blix and Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Baradei">El Baradei</a> to the Iraqi regime, setting out further very important conditions on the operation of the inspection regime. We cannot be sure that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will comply—it is in its interests to do so—but we can be sure that if it fails to do so, it will be in material breach. That will then be reported to the Security Council, and serious consequences will follow.</p></div>

If there is a further material breach, meetings of the Security Council will be called, and there will be discussions. It is open to any member of the Security Council—including, obviously, the United Kingdom—to put forward a resolution or resolutions about the circumstances that will then obtain. We of course reserve the right to do so, but I cannot at this stage anticipate what could happen in a series of hypothetical situations. I have already given undertakings on the issue of matters being debated, discussed and determined by this House.

The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> proposed the setting up of a new conference on that process, but little progress seems to have been made.

I wish to underline a point that has been made only twice today so far. If international action follows, as I fear it will, the widest possible coalition of international support in the middle east should be sought, so that we receive, if not the active support, at least the passive acquiescence of those countries that will suffer most from the fallout of that action.</p></div>

All of us who have been involved in the process are aware of the anxieties of the public, which I share—as do the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the United States—about the prospect of military action being used. Military action should never be used except as a last resort when all other possibilities have been exhausted. It should not be used because innocent people get killed in military action, because unintended consequences may occur and because we put the lives of our troops and the future of their families on the line. Those are serious responsibilities that we have to shoulder and ensure that they are reflected in our work. They have been so reflected here and, I believe strongly, in the United States. All my reading suggests that public opinion in the United States, and in the Administration, is no different in almost all particulars from that here or elsewhere.</p> <p pid=".442.6/2">As for the resolution of the Palestine-Israel question, I agree that that is viewed slightly differently across the Atlantic. As I have said, we must work closely with our American friends, as well as with those in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation">Russian Federation</a>, the EU and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5">P5</a> group to secure justice for Israelis and Palestinians.</p></div>

The fairest thing to be said is that, although there is a wide spectrum of public opinion in this country, in Europe and in the US, there is no doubt that there is a much higher level of support for firm action within the UN route than outwith it. That is one of the many reasons why we have been determined, as far as humanly possible, to follow the UN route and to stay with it.</p></div>

I would personally be very happy to wait until the beginning of next week if by doing so we get 14 or 15 signed up to the resolution rather than a lower number.</p> <p pid=".449.3/2">On the no-fly zones, decisions will have to be taken about them in the light of circumstances. Self-evidently, they operate not under this resolution but under previous resolutions, but neither we nor the United States have an interest in continuing to operate the no-fly zones longer than necessary.</p> <p pid=".449.3/3">On the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRC">DRC</a>, my hon.

I would not dream of disagreeing with him—no one who had seen his size would do so. This is a question of ambiguity, and an important issue is involved. There is an issue of regime change and of removing the current regime under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> from office. Is that the purpose of the resolution? No. It is not mentioned once in the resolution. As a matter of interpretation, if Saddam Hussein has his weapons of mass destruction removed, does that, in turn, change the nature of the regime? Yes.</p></div>
