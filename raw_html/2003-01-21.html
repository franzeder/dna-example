                                              21st January 2003                    </a>
              
                          </h2>


                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".167.1/1">With permission, Mr. <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I should like to make a statement on yesterday's ministerial meeting of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, which was called to discuss the international community's response to global terrorism. I have placed a copy of my speech to the Security Council in the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=271" title="See &quot;placed in the library&quot;." class="glossary">Library of the House</a>. After the formal meeting, Security Council members discussed <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and North Korea in informal session.</p> <p pid=".167.1/2">The focus of the Council's meeting was the work of its counter-terrorism committee, which was established by United Nations Security Council resolution 1373. This resolution was passed in the wake of the <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> atrocity, and for the first time imposed a legal obligation on all countries to end safe havens for terrorists, and to stop terrorist financing. The committee has been chaired by our own ambassador to the UN, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Jeremy_Greenstock">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</a>, who yesterday received many tributes for his work. I know that the House will want to endorse those tributes, which were fully deserved.</p> <p pid=".167.1/3">Under the committee's programme, each country's progress in countering terrorism is actively being scrutinised. Where necessary, the committee is helping countries to improve their capacity to deal with terrorism. As we heard yesterday in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a>, the vast <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of Governments, about 180, are complying with the new obligations on them. However, two—those of Liberia and, for very separate reasons, of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor">East Timor</a>—have failed to respond at all, and 13 are months behind. Therefore a deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31"><span class="hi">31</span> March</phrase> was set yesterday for compliance.</p> <p pid=".167.1/4">Yesterday's meeting then discussed and unanimously agreed a new resolution on terrorism. Its key elements include the adoption of new measures to improve and to reinforce the work of the counter-terrorism committee; a recognition that the fight against terrorism has to be linked to international action against the proliferation of conventional arms and of weapons of mass destruction; and our agreement that our struggle against terrorism is not biased against any religion—including Islam. People of all faiths and of all cultures have been the innocent victims of terrorist attacks, and people of every faith have a common interest in countering the global threat.</p> <p pid=".167.1/5">In adopting the resolution, the Security Council recognised the dangerous connection between the terrorists who respect no rules, and the rogue states that know no rules either. It is the leaders of such rogue states who set a deadly example, and—through their illegal programmes to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons—provide a tempting arsenal for terrorists.</p> <p pid=".167.1/6">Eight years ago, the world woke up to the nexus between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction when a sarin gas attack inflicted thousands of casualties in Tokyo. Since then, there has been abundant evidence that the al-Qaeda terrorist organisation is trying to acquire and to develop substances that are just as lethal, if not more so. There can be no doubt at all that al-Qaeda would use such weapons of mass destruction—nerve gases, viruses and even nuclear weapons—if it could lay its hands on them.</p> <p pid=".167.1/7">There are some who argue that the issue of proliferation is an unwelcome distraction from the campaign against terrorism. This view is profoundly misplaced, however. The global trade in weapons of mass destruction technologies has never been more dangerous. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean">North Korean</a> missile exports undermine security in the middle east. Illegal Iraqi imports of weapons-related technology flout United Nations sanctions, and are re-arming a regime that has previously shown no restraint in using mustard gas and nerve agent to murder thousands of its own people. It would therefore be wildly irresponsible to assume that we can turn a blind eye to this trade on the presumption that lethal materials will not ultimately fall into the hands of terrorists. In today's climate, no responsible Government could take such a risk with their citizens' lives.</p> <p pid=".167.1/8">The two greatest threats facing Britain and its citizens in the next decade are terrorists and rogue states with weapons of mass destruction. The most dangerous terrorist organisation is al-Qaeda. The most aggressive rogue state is <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Since the adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 1441 last November, the choice for the Iraqi regime has been clear: resolve the 12-year stand-off with the UN peacefully through full co-operation with weapons inspectors, or face disarmament by force. Typically, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s response so far has been characterised much more by deceit and delay than by any interest in a peaceful outcome.</p> <p pid=".167.1/9">The initial Iraqi declaration of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD">WMD</a> holdings submitted to the UN on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-07">7 December</phrase> contained stark omissions, not least the failure to explain what has happened to the large quantities of chemical and biological weapons matériel unaccounted for by UN inspectors in 1998 and set out in a report of more than 200 pages to the UN by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCOM">UNSCOM</a> inspectors—the previous inspectors—in February 1999.</p> <p pid=".167.1/10">Last week UN inspectors discovered 12 chemical warheads, and a large quantity of hidden documents relating to a possible nuclear weapons programme, which were found within the area of a private house. Neither of these finds had been declared. Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> and Dr. Mohamed el-Baradei used their visit to Baghdad last weekend to set out their concerns to the Iraqi regime about the lack of Iraqi co-operation, and to remind the regime of the "serious consequences" of failure to abide by the terms of Security Council resolution 1441.</p> <p pid=".167.1/11">On Monday next, <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January</phrase>, Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei will submit their progress reports on the inspection processes to the Security Council. I plainly cannot anticipate those reports, but two things are clear: first, the international community must maintain the pressure on Saddam Hussein to end his games of hide and seek. Secondly, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> must comply fully, actively and positively with all its international obligations. As my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence reminded the House yesterday in announcing further troop deployments to the Gulf, the lesson of the past four months is that diplomatic pressure will have no effect without the visible and credible threat of force.</p> <p pid=".167.1/12">The terrorist threat to Britain and our citizens is real. My right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> is co-ordinating the most comprehensive security response our country has seen for many years. Our country can never become an island of security in the face of the global dangers of terrorism and rogue states, so just as we should redouble our efforts to enforce the law at home, our interests demand that we be at the forefront of enforcing the law overseas.</p> <p pid=".167.1/13">For too long, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has flouted international legal obligations to disarm, and has laughed in the face of the United Nations. Saddam still has a choice to comply and I hope very much that he does so. If he does not, those who are serious about a commitment to a global community based on the rule of law and the United Nations cannot afford to shrink from the challenge posed by <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".169.0/1">I thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> for his statement and for giving me advance sight of it.</p> <p pid=".169.0/2">I echo the right hon. Gentleman's tribute to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Jeremy_Greenstock">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</a> for the work that he has done, and I welcome the new Security Council resolution on terrorism which was passed yesterday.</p> <p pid=".169.0/3">I agree with the Foreign Secretary's analysis of the current situation and his warnings about the relationships between rogue states and international terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p pid=".169.0/4">We are now moving inexorably, whether by diplomacy, force or voluntary exile, towards the end game in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, in which the central issue of weapons of mass destruction will be resolved. We firmly continue to support the objective of eliminating <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s evil armoury and his arms development programmes.</p> <p pid=".169.0/5">Since last September I have consistently pressed a number of requirements in pursuance of that objective: the need to pursue the United Nations route; the need to be totally transparent and clear with the British people as to what the options for future action are, and why; the need to concentrate on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction as the key objective; the need to have a clear and comprehensive plan for the future of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>; and the need for substantial humanitarian support for the suffering people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".169.0/6">On the United Nations route, does the right hon. Gentleman consider that there is now a prima facie case that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is in material breach of resolution 1441, under paragraph 4? In his view, does last week's proven failure to disclose warhead casings and documents, followed by further continuing failure to comply with this and other resolutions, amount to a material breach?</p> <p pid=".169.0/7">I heard the Foreign Secretary recorded as saying in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> that his patience with Saddam Hussein was running out, and that he was not impressed by <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> recent actions. In terms of resolution 1441 and the forthcoming report by the inspectors, what does that mean? Presumably, it is that he believes that Saddam Hussein is continuing to fail to comply, thus establishing material breach.</p> <p pid=".169.0/8">Does the right hon. Gentleman realise, however, how much work still needs to be done to persuade the British people that Britain's interests and the safety of British citizens will be at risk if action is not taken to eliminate these weapons of mass destruction? It is simply not enough to talk in vague terms about the general relationship of terrorism with rogue states. If, as the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> implied last Monday, intelligence suggests that there is a real, present and growing danger, the British people should be given more factual information—and urgently.</p> <p pid=".169.0/9">Will the Foreign Secretary accept from me that we will support action to protect and defend British interests, and so will the British people, but that we could not support going to war just because another country asks us to?</p> <p pid=".169.0/10">I realise the risk of compromising intelligence sources, but if these dangers are as substantial as the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> hinted, surely a formula could be found to inform the British public of their nature and imminence? Does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that there is nothing more dangerous in these circumstances than obfuscation or mixed messages?

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".170.0/1">I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's opening remarks, in particular his endorsement of the tributes to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Jeremy_Greenstock">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</a>.</p> <p pid=".170.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman asked me a series of questions. I shall try to answer each.</p> <p pid=".170.0/3">First, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether I thought there was now a prima facie case that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is in material breach. Under operational paragraph 4 of the resolution, there are two limbs to the definition of material breach. One is a failure in respect of the disclosure. There has also to be some other failure to comply with the obligations of the resolution. There is no doubt that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has already failed the first limb, as it failed fully to disclose all its holdings. It remains to be seen whether it has failed the second test set by the second limb of operational paragraph 4. We in the international community will be in a better position to assess that after next Monday's discussion in the Security Council.</p> <p pid=".170.0/4"><a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=697" title="Our page on Michael Ancram - &#39;The right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)&#39;">Mr. Ancram</a> said that he heard me say that my patience was running out. In fact, I said that the international community's patience was running out. <i>[Interruption.]</i> And mine too, but I do not presume to speak for the community as a whole. However, from a personal point of view, I was not impressed with the 10-point plan that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has apparently agreed with the inspectors. Every one of those 10 points is non-negotiable under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> resolution 1441—they include matters such as overflights by surveillance aeroplanes and non-intrusive interviews with Iraqi scientists—and <span class="hi">Iraq</span> should have been complying with them since <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-08">8 November</phrase>, when resolution 1441 was passed.</p> <p pid=".170.0/5">Of course I accept that we have to take the British public with us on this matter, and we have worked hard to do so. That is well illustrated in our contacts with the British people. There will be great debate about public opinion polls, and all of us, whatever we say, take account of them. The polls show that there is very significant support for the UN route, which is precisely the route that we have followed.</p> <p pid=".170.0/6">The right hon. Member for Devizes asks about more intelligence being made available. This Government have been more open about publishing what intelligence we can than any previous Government, but the right hon. Gentleman knows and accepts that we cannot publish intelligence if the result would be to compromise the source or to end the flow of intelligence. I suggest that those two factors must remain, for the time being, the more important considerations.</p> <p pid=".170.0/7">The right hon. Member for Devizes asks about further debates. Yes, there will be a full day's debate tomorrow—[Hon. Members: "It will be a defence debate."] I do not know whether the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> have noticed, but a quarter of Britain's troops are just about to go to the Gulf, with the possibility of being involved in military action in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, if that is justified. I hazard a guess that tomorrow's defence debate will be dominated by the issue of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p></div>

However, the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has stated repeatedly that there is no link between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and terrorism. In dealing with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> resolution 1441 sets out in considerable detail how the international community should handle matters, including promising serious consequences if the regime fails to comply.</p> <p pid=".171.2/3">Last week, Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> said that there was "no smoking gun" arising from his work so far, but the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> told the UN yesterday that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".171.2/4">"there comes a moment when our patience must run out. We are near that point with <span class="hi">Iraq</span>."</p> <p pid=".171.2/5">In view of the Foreign Secretary's latest comments and the announcement of the military build-up in the Gulf, will he confirm that the Government remain committed to the process set out in resolution 1441? Does he agree that the Security Council as a whole should consider the reports of the inspectors, that the successful continuation of their work should be the primary focus of the United Nations, and that the process should not be prejudged by impatient or precipitate moves towards war by any Security Council members?</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".172.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his opening remarks.</p> <p pid=".172.0/2">On the question of whether there is a link between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and terrorism, my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has given precise answers—as he did earlier today before the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_Committee">Liaison Committee</a>. When he said that there has been no link between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and terrorism, he was explicitly referring to al-Qaeda in the run-up to <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>. There is of course a lot of linkage between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and terrorism generally. One of the international terrorist organisations that I banned—proscribed under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_Act_2000">Terrorism Act 2000</a>—was the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEK">MEK</a>, an Iraqi-backed terrorist organisation operating in Iran. Moreover, the Iraqi regime actively supports several rejectionist terrorist organisations, including Hamas and Hezbollah which operate inside Israel and the occupied territories. We have to recognise the possibility of great danger if we fail to deal both with what the hon. Gentleman described as international terrorism and with the murderous regimes in rogue states. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> would have been a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> of what it was had it not been able to base and feed itself in a rogue state—at that stage, Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.</p> <p pid=".172.0/3">The hon. Gentleman asked whether the Government are committed to the route set out in 1441. Yes. It should never be forgotten that it was a joint United States/United Kingdom draft resolution that the Security Council passed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-08">8 November</phrase>.</p> <p pid=".172.0/4">Should the Security Council consider the reports of the inspectors? Yes. That is set out in the resolution. Should we ensure that we do not prejudge the results of inspections? Yes: but it should never be forgotten by those who see <span class="hi">Iraq</span> through rose-tinted spectacles that there were no inspectors in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> between the end of 1998 and the beginning of this year because <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had excluded them, in flagrant violation of international law. It was only active US-UK diplomacy, backed by a credible threat of force, which led, first, to the passage of 1441 and then to the readmission of inspectors. Yes, of course the inspectors have to do their job, but we make it easier and more effective by keeping up the pressure and reminding everyone that the closing paragraph of 1441, signed up to by every member of the Security Council, including Syria and many others, spelled out that if <span class="hi">Iraq</span> failed to meet its obligations "serious consequences would follow". The words "serious consequences" have only one meaning—the use of force.</p></div>

If we are to make real progress in the war against international terrorism, we need a much clearer strategy.

Time without number during my 24 years as a Member of the House, I have heard more members of his party than of mine say that we should set clear examples in respect of criminal behaviour in this country, not only in dealing with immediate cases of criminality but also by ensuring that there is clear deterrence. I share that view and I believe that the same principles apply in dealing with the international criminals who run those rogue states.</p> <p pid=".173.3/2">We cannot do everything at once—the hon. Gentleman is right—but that does not mean that we should do nothing. There is much that we can do and we have to deal with the worst case. That is the strategy. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is clearly in a league of its own. It is the only member of the United Nations that is in flagrant violation of 23 separate UN obligations.</p></div>

Of course I am relying on the history, but it is very recent history.

He has launched missile attacks on five of his neighbours, including Iran and Kuwait. He has murdered hundreds and thousands of Iranians and thousands of Kuwaitis, and he has also killed thousands of his own people. He is in a league of his own. We are now asked to give the benefit of doubt to that same man, and we cannot do that.</p> <p pid=".174.5/2">The right hon. and learned Gentleman then asks about containment. The simple fact of the matter is that containment may well not have worked. That is why we have the inspectors. If containment had worked, the inspectors would not have faced a situation where they could not properly inspect. They had to leave in November 1998. They then said that thousands of tonnes of chemicals to make biological and chemical weapons were still unaccounted for in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. That is why the onus is on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to explain fully to the inspectors that it is now clean.

If the international community is to mean anything at all, it has to mean that its will can be enforced.

That is being rather gentle about a man who is absolutely tyrannical in the way that he treats his own and other people, but I am happy to call <span class="hi">Iraq</span> a tyrannical state. Those who run those states are rogues—they are psychopathic killers—and the experience of their people is totally outwith any of our experiences.</p> <p pid=".177.2/2">As far as the build-up of military force is concerned—I know that there are strong feelings on this issue, which will continue, as is right in a democracy—I notice that the debate has shifted, and there is now wide acceptance that Saddam must comply with his United Nations obligations, to which my hon. Friend accedes. We have only achieved the return of the inspectors because we have employed a credible threat of force. I last went to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-10">10 September</phrase> last year, the day on which the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=91" title="The office of Deputy Prime Minister is one that has only existed..." class="glossary">Deputy Prime Minister</a> of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> issued a formal statement on behalf of his leader, Saddam Hussein, saying that there were no circumstances whatever in which <span class="hi">Iraq</span> would readmit weapons inspectors. That has changed for one reason only: a credible threat of force is being exercised. I am sorry to say that that is the only language that that tyrannical rogue understands. If there is to be a credible threat of force, the consequences are that that threat must be increased the closer one gets to its deployment. I still hope and pray that the message gets through to Saddam Hussein that the game is up and that he must now comply fully and actively with all the Security Council obligations. If he does so, there will be no military action, and no one would be more pleased about that than me.</p></div>

Surely the assembly of rogue states, failed states and proliferating states that pose a short-term and long-term threat in the assistance that they can give to terrorist movements will have to be addressed by the international community, which will have to be brought and held together in a war against terrorism.

On the other two points, I do not know why the hon. Gentleman keeps raising the issue of a vote in the House. We have already said, as I spelt out in the debate here on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-25">25 November</phrase>, that there would be a vote on a substantive resolution on military action. My right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> spelt it out again this morning before the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_Committee">Liaison Committee</a>, and we have also spelt out that it is our earnest hope that such a vote will take place in advance of military action. The only circumstances in which a vote would have to take place shortly after military action commenced would be if it were unsafe for our troops to have it in advance. We hope very much that it will take place in advance.</p> <p pid=".180.0/2">We have also said that we will seek a second resolution. That is our policy. Our preference is for a second resolution if military action is judged necessary, but—to pick up a point raised earlier by one of my hon. Friends—we have to reserve the right if the Security Council itself does not live up to its responsibilities.</p></div>

Friend that no attempt whatever is being made to get the inspectors out of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. The only attempt that is being made is to create an environment in which they can do their job properly. It does not depend on us, the United States or any other member of the Security Council; it all depends on the Government of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. When Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei went to Baghdad at the weekend, their message to the Iraqi regime was that it had to co-operate. That is the message that they are delivering.</p> <p pid=".181.0/2">As to next Monday's discussion, I wanted—I stand by this—to ensure that people understood that resolution 1441 did not lay down in its terms that this was a deadline or the end of the inspection process. When the inspection process happens is a matter, first of all, for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> and his choices but, secondly, for the Security Council, which is literally the employer of Dr. Blix and Dr el-Baradei and gives them their instructions.</p></div>
