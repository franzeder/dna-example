                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".1056.1/1">With permission, Mr. <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I should like to make a statement about <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. I thought that it would be helpful, given that the House is in recess next week.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/2">The Security Council will meet in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> tomorrow to hear the latest reports from the executive chairman of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a>, Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a>, and the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. Mohamed el-Baradei. I will be joining fellow Foreign Ministers for that meeting.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> resolution 1441, which was agreed three months ago, placed the onus squarely on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to co-operate fully and actively with United Nations inspectors in the disarmament of its weapons of mass destruction. It gave <span class="hi">Iraq</span> a final warning: comply with the UN's terms immediately or face "serious consequences." European Union Foreign Ministers expressed clear support for that goal last month when they declared unanimously that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/4">"the resolution gives an unambiguous message that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Government">Iraqi Government</a> has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully."</p> <p pid=".1056.1/5">It is also worth recalling that at the summit in Prague, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> Heads of Government—every one of the 19 present—explicitly endorsed resolution 1441. They said that it was a final opportunity and that serious consequences would follow.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/6">Tomorrow's briefing will be the fourth update delivered by Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei. The comprehensive reports that they delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January</phrase>, just over two weeks ago, painted a disturbing picture. Most damning of all was Dr. Blix's observation that <span class="hi">Iraq</span></p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/7">"appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance...of the disarmament which was demanded of it".</p> <p pid=".1056.1/8">Dr. Blix concluded that the Iraqi declaration submitted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-07">7 December</phrase>, in accordance with resolution 1441, was</p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/9">"mostly a reprint of earlier documents," and did not</p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/11">"contain any new evidence that would eliminate" unresolved</p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/13">"questions or reduce their number."</p> <p pid=".1056.1/14">The central premise of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> so-called disclosure—that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> possesses no weapons of mass destruction—was, and remains, a lie. Nor was there any admission of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> extensive efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction since the final <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCOM">UNSCOM</a> inspections in December 1998 when it was effectively excluded from <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, as the inspectors made clear in their final report to the Security Council in February 1999.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/15">In their update on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January</phrase>, Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei said that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had failed to account for 6,500 bombs, which could carry up to 1,000 tonnes of chemical agent. It had also failed to account for 8,500 litres of biological warfare agent and a large amount of growth media, which could be used to produce about 5,000 litres of concentrated anthrax. They said that the 12 chemical rocket warheads unearthed by UNMOVIC inspectors were potentially, in Dr. Blix's words,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/16">"the tip of a submerged iceberg".</p> <p pid=".1056.1/17">They said that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had failed to disclose the 3,000 pages of documents discovered not in an office but in the grounds of the private home of an Iraqi scientist, relating to the nuclear weapons programme of that country. They said that despite repeated requests from UNMOVIC and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAEA">IAEA</a>, in accordance with resolution 1441, all interviews with key Iraqi personnel were being conducted in the intimidating presence of official "minders". They also said that in contravention of United Nations resolutions, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had developed missiles that had been tested at ranges in excess of the 150 km limit specified in UN resolutions.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/18">I remind the House that the British Government drew attention to Iraqi work on such missiles in the dossier that we published last September. We look forward to hearing in detail what Dr. Blix has to say tomorrow, but if media reports are correct, the al-Samoud missile programme is clearly in serious breach of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> obligations. We would expect rapid action to eliminate any such illegal programme.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/19">In drafting resolution 1441, Security Council members took pains to set two clear tests for further material breach by <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. In the first operational paragraph, they declared that <span class="hi">Iraq</span></p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/20">"has been and remains in material breach" of a score or more of obligations that date back to 1991. That is still the case. As for the two tests, a further material breach would have occurred, first, if <span class="hi">Iraq</span> made "false statements" or "omissions" in the declaration that it submitted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-07">7 December</phrase>, and secondly, if it failed</p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/22">"at any time to comply with, and co-operate fully in the implementation" of resolution 1441. The briefings by Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei, as well as Secretary Powell's presentation to the Security Council last week, leave no doubt that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has failed to meet both tests. The conclusion is therefore inescapable: <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is in further material breach of resolution 1441. We shall take full account of the reports of the chief inspectors tomorrow.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/24">The prospect of military action causes obvious anxiety—as it should—here in the United Kingdom, here in the House, among our allies and in the region, and of course among the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. I still hope and pray for a peaceful outcome to the crisis, but that will be possible only if we maintain unrelenting pressure on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, including the threat of force, rather than casting around for excuses to delay. It is only through the pressure we have been exercising that we have got as far as we have in exposing much more of the danger represented by Saddam Hussein's regime, and exposing his lies and deception as well. If the international community lost its nerve now, that would significantly undermine the UN's authority and make the world a much more dangerous place, as dictators got the message that international law consisted of mere words and nothing else.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/25">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-German">Franco-German</a> proposals announced this week to bolster the inspection regime will not deliver the assurance that the world needs about <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> weapons. Those proposals, I am sorry to say, are unrealistic and impractical. They shift the burden of proof from Iraq—which is where the Security Council has said it must be—to the inspectors, and they send Saddam the signal that defiance pays. What is the point of sending three times as many inspectors simply for Saddam to deceive them? What purpose is served by that? As Dr. Blix himself said on Monday,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/26">"The principal problem is not the number of inspectors but rather the active co-operation of the Iraqi side, as we have said many times."</p> <p pid=".1056.1/27">Those are the words of the chief inspector, not my words.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/28">If the inspectors were to say that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was actively co-operating, one might see a possible case for more inspectors; but I ask my hon. Friends, as well as <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members, to consider what it is like to inspect anything without the co-operation of the organisation being inspected.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/29"><span class="hi">Iraq</span> was found guilty of possession of weapons of mass destruction 12 years ago. The role of inspectors has always been to verify Iraqi compliance—this being based on the premise of Iraqi compliance—and not to engage in a</p> <p class="indent" pid=".1056.1/30">"game of catch as catch can", to use Dr. Blix's term.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/32">I am glad to learn that other proposals attributed to the French and German Governments, such as the establishment of a no-fly zone over the whole of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and the insertion of armed blue-helmeted UN troops, have now been officially denied. Had those proposals been implemented, they would have required an even higher degree of co-operation from the Iraqi regime than was required by resolution 1441. The creation of a no-fly zone over the whole of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> would have required the complete grounding of the Iraqi air force and its regular inspection to that end, and the insertion of blue-helmeted UN troops in a benign environment would have required all armed troops from <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to retreat to barracks. That too would have been the subject of inspection by the United Nations.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/33">Let me now turn to the position in NATO. In mid-January, discussions began in the alliance of the need for contingency planning to cope with possible threats to the security of a NATO ally, Turkey, in the event of military action in respect of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Sixteen NATO allies, including 14 European nations, supported that entirely reasonable and responsible proposal simply to set in hand some military planning for very limited defensive mutual assistance. France, Belgium and Germany have resisted on the ground that a NATO decision on that very limited mutual assistance would somehow pre-empt any Security Council consideration of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> further material breach. Faced with that deadlock, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February</phrase> Turkey requested consultations under article 4 of the Washington treaty. The discussions continue, with the United Kingdom fully supporting the efforts of NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson to achieve consensus.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/34">I remind the House again that at the Prague summit, less than three months ago, NATO leaders pledged their full support for resolution 1441.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/35">Given the obvious risks and the possibility that military action may prove necessary, we are keeping under very close review the safety and security of both visiting and resident British nationals in the various countries of the middle east. We make assessments on a case-by-case basis for each country in the region, and will make announcements as necessary.</p> <p pid=".1056.1/36">Even at this late stage, armed <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> is not inevitable. A peaceful resolution of the crisis remains in Saddam Hussein's hands. Full Iraqi compliance with the terms of Security Council resolution 1441 will deliver the outcome that the United Kingdom and the entire international community wish to see: an <span class="hi">Iraq</span> that no longer poses a threat to its neighbours or to the region. In the absence of full compliance by Saddam Hussein, however, United Nations inspectors will not be able to fulfil their mandate to verify Iraqi disarmament. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_1441">Resolution 1441</a> warns <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to expect "serious consequences" in that event. By now, even Saddam Hussein must be under no illusions: that can only mean disarmament by force.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".1059.0/1">My right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=697" title="Our page on Michael Ancram - &#39;the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)&#39;">Mr. Ancram</a>, the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, is in China, and apologises for not being here today. I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement, and for giving us a copy in advance.</p> <p pid=".1059.0/2">The statement comes at a time when diplomatic relations between the United States and both France and Germany are, to put it mildly, scratchy. Public opinion here suggests that people are losing trust in the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, and, crucially, we may be witnessing historic strains on the stability of a number of institutions that we have taken for granted for decades, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>, the European Union and even the United Nations itself. However, we offer the Government our full support in their efforts to enable NATO to send missiles to defend Turkey. While we can understand America's fury at the attitude of France and Germany, we ask the Foreign Secretary to join us in urging our counterparts in Congress not to be drawn into recriminations against them. Whatever their feelings, we surely do not want relations between western democracies to slide into disarray.</p> <p pid=".1059.0/3">The Foreign Secretary has said that we must wait for Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a>'s statement to the United Nations tomorrow, and of course he is right. Any decision about <span class="hi">Iraq</span> requires an agonisingly difficult moral assessment. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_1441">Resolution 1441</a> enshrines a judgment, which we share, that the cost of doing nothing is greater than the cost of doing something. Does the Foreign Secretary accept that if we are on the brink of military conflict, as seems likely, the issue must above all be approached with honesty and clarity? Given that resolution 1441 is fundamentally about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s arsenal of weapons, and given the doubting mood of public opinion, do not talk of Iraqi links with al-Qaeda and links with terrorism, conflicting comments from Ministers, and the publication of an utterly substandard dossier only divert attention from the main issue and severely dent the Government's credibility?</p> <p pid=".1059.0/4">A fortnight ago, a second UN resolution seemed a dead cert, but now it seems touch and go. The Foreign Secretary made no mention at all of a second resolution in his statement. Is it his intention still to go for one, and if so, when does he expect it to be voted on? If Hans Blix tomorrow reconfirms that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is in material breach of resolution 1441, the Foreign Secretary said that "rapid action" will be taken, apparently, from what he said, by force, but how rapid is rapid? I think the Foreign Secretary and I agree that we respect those who take a principled stand against any military action. We also hope that they respect our shared view that we should not resile from implementing UN resolution 1441. Does the Foreign Secretary not agree that it is impossible to have any respect for a party leader who says that we must wait for Hans Blix, and then announces in advance of tomorrow's statement that he is going to go on the anti-war march on Saturday? After sitting on so many fences at once, it is no wonder that the leader of the Liberal Democrat party finds it so difficult to walk straight.</p> <p pid=".1059.0/5">If Saddam Hussein goes, it is the clear intention of all involved in removing him to replace his regime with a democratic one if at all possible. But is it not a fundamental concept of any democracy that any Government should be accountable for their action to their electorate either directly or through Parliament; and is it not therefore a fundamental right of the British people that any UK military action should be subject to a substantive motion in the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>?</p> <p pid=".1059.0/6">The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for International Development has so far refused to reveal any plans she may have for humanitarian aid to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, and in <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> today she says that there will not be any aid anyway if there is not a second UN resolution. It is therefore doubly worrying that the Foreign Secretary made no reference to a second resolution today. At the very least, will he say what the Government's plans are for humanitarian aid, even if his <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> colleague will not? I welcome the news this week that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> has had talks with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ala">Abu Ala</a> from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority">Palestinian Authority</a>. Will the Foreign Secretary once again confirm our shared view that any action in or around the middle east needs to go hand in hand with a revival of the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, without which there will never be stability in the wider Arab world?</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".1060.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Of course I understand the absence of his right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>.</p> <p pid=".1060.0/2">Going through the points that the hon. Gentleman made, I accept that it is wise if we want to resolve this matter and ensure the cohesion of those key alliances of which we are members—<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> and the European Union—and, above all, maintain the authority of the United Nations, that we should seek to lower, rather than raise, the temperature of relations with countries with which we have great friendships, both within Europe and across the Atlantic.</p> <p pid=".1060.0/3">On the issue of the dossier, my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> dealt with that yesterday. We accept that parts of the document should have been made clearer, but I tell the House and the hon. Gentleman that the document itself was accurate in every particular—the part that was claimed to be from intelligence was from intelligence. As regards the second resolution, the reason why I did not explicitly mention the prospect of one is that we are waiting to hear what Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei say. It is our decision as to whether or not we move a second resolution, and of course one remains in prospect. My view is that, rather than speculate about whether or not we move a second resolution and about what it says, having heard what Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei said on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January</phrase>, we should wait and see what they say tomorrow, then make our decisions. Subject only to recesses, our decisions will be reported to the House as quickly as possible. I also reinforce the point made by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House at business questions—the fact that the Security Council meets at times other than when the House is sitting means that we cannot always ensure that decisions made there coincide exactly with our sittings.</p> <p pid=".1060.0/4">The hon. Gentleman made some interesting remarks about the leader of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>. It is a matter for the right hon. Gentleman as to whether he goes on this march, but I have read all his statements carefully. The more I read them, the more completely confused I believe he is. For those who believe either that he is against any military action in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> or that he believes, as he said on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-25">25 November</phrase> in the House, that military action can only take place if there is a second resolution, I commend to the House the transcript of his interview on the "Today" programme on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January</phrase>, in which he openly admitted that while a second resolution was his preference—he prayed the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and myself in aid of that assertion—he then said that we might have to go without a second resolution—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, we look forward to further elucidation.</p> <p pid=".1060.0/5"><a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=867" title="Our page on Alan Duncan - &#39;The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan)&#39;">Mr. Duncan</a> referred to a substantive resolution. I agree, and always have done. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will acknowledge that we have made a policy of introducing substantive resolutions in the House. That happened on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-25">25 November</phrase>, when we had a very good debate. There was a clear choice before the House—rather than a choice of whether we went home or not, there was a choice about the policy that we should follow. The Government's policy, which was supported by the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>, was backed by a vote of about 450 to 80, which I take to be a mandate on any basis.</p> <p pid=".1060.0/6">As for a substantive resolution on military action, again, we have made it very clear first, that there will be a substantive resolution and, secondly, that it is our earnest intention and hope that that should take place in advance of any military action save in the one circumstance in which we judge that our troops would be put at risk. On such an occasion, the arrangement, as happened with the Conservative Government in January 1991, would take place a few days afterwards. That, too, however, would be very much second best. The overwhelmingly important issue, apart from all the other issues, is that the legitimacy of any action that we take as a British Government should be endorsed by the House, so that if our troops go into any action and place their lives on the line, they do so in the knowledge that they have the support of the British people as represented in the House.</p> <p pid=".1060.0/7">Finally, on the middle east peace process, I entirely endorse what the hon. Gentleman said about the paramountcy of pursuing that process, which is why the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_and_I">Prime Minister and I</a> were determined to go ahead with consultations with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority">Palestinian Authority</a> notwithstanding the banning by Mr. Sharon of attendance at that meeting. On humanitarian aid, I do not recognise the description of my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for International Development. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_International_Development">Department for International Development</a> is already providing millions of pounds to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, and my right hon. Friends the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Secretary">Defence Secretary</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Secretary">International Development Secretary</a>, the Prime Minister and I had a detailed discussion this morning, as we have done for many weeks, about the nature of further humanitarian assistance and its conditions should military action prove necessary against <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p></div>

The Government have repeatedly made it clear that the international community can only deal effectively with <span class="hi">Iraq</span> if we are united. Does the Foreign Secretary therefore accept the concern that to ignore the vetoes in the Security Council may have serious consequences for that unity and would undermine the Security Council's role? Does he also accept the need to tone down the rhetoric on the part of Government to minimise the damage currently being done in relations with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> and our EU partners, and with Russia and China? Will he use this opportunity to distance himself clearly from the suggestions being made in America that Germany and France should face economic sanctions or that American troops should be withdrawn from Germany as a result of this week's disagreements?</p> <p pid=".1062.0/2">In his statement, the Foreign Secretary dismissed the French and Russian proposals that were put forward this week. Can he tell the House whether he has sought meetings with the French and the Russians about those proposals, and why he so quickly dismisses the option of further UN inspection and containment?</p> <p pid=".1062.0/3">At the Security Council meeting tomorrow, I hope that Britain will lend its support to the work of the inspectors. If the inspectors believe that with more time, co-operation and space, progress could be made, they should be given more time. Will the Foreign Secretary commit himself to that, and recognise that the vast <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of members of the public who will be marching this weekend support the view, as does the Liberal Democrat leader, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Kennedy">Charles Kennedy</a>, that we should put our faith in the United Nations and allow the inspectors more time?</p> <p pid=".1062.0/4">Finally, may I ask the Foreign Secretary to give a firm commitment that if a UN resolution is tabled next Monday, the House will be recalled on Tuesday for a full debate on that resolution?</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".1062.1/1">First, may I say two things about <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=781" title="Our page on Menzies Campbell - &#39;the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell)&#39;">Mr. Campbell</a>, for whom the hon. Gentleman is deputising? I am sure that I speak for the whole House when I say that it is a matter of great pleasure to hear that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is making good progress. I also take the opportunity to record our congratulations to him on having been elected deputy leader of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>.</p> <p pid=".1062.1/2">The hon. Member for Winchester asked about us ignoring vetoes. We do not want to be in that position. We are asking all members of the Security Council, when they come to assess the report of Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei, to follow through the true meaning of the language to which every single member of the Security Council signed up on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-08">8 November</phrase>. We cannot be in the position where we and other members of the Security Council believe that conclusions following from the true meaning of 1441 are inescapable, but one member, for example, seeks to avoid those conclusions. In the end, the decisions that the British Government make must be a matter for the British Government endorsed by the House, not for another member state.</p> <p pid=".1062.1/3">We want a second resolution if we deem military action to be necessary. That has always been our position, but let it also be clear that 1441 is a sufficient mandate for such military action, because 1441 spells out with complete clarity that there are obligations on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> that it must follow through—very straightforward obligations. If <span class="hi">Iraq</span> follows them through, there will be—there can be—no military action whatever. If <span class="hi">Iraq</span> fails to follow those obligations through, it will be in further material breach, and if it is in further material breach, serious consequences—force—will follow. There was a suggestion in the United Nations when we negotiated 1441 that there had to be written into 1441 a requirement for a second resolution if military force was to take place. That was dropped from the final draft, which is how we ended up with 1441 in its present form.</p> <p pid=".1062.1/4">The hon. Gentleman asked me about discussions with my French and Russian counterparts. We have discussions all the time. I shall be having more discussions with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Ivanov">Igor Ivanov</a> and Dominique de Villepin tomorrow. I accept entirely, as I did in response to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, that we do not want to be involved in recriminations between friendly member states of the United Nations, so we will not get involved in that.</p> <p pid=".1062.1/5">On further United Nations inspections, I said in a speech on Tuesday this week that if the inspectors themselves ask for more resources, of course we will consider that, but we cannot be drawn into the argument from outside the inspectors' ranks, which seeks to imply that, in the absence of co-operation, more inspectors will resolve the matter. They will not. Procrastination is not the solution to the problem; co-operation is.</p></div>

The evidence in respect of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> possession of weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons and weapons programmes, and its readiness to develop a nuclear weapons programme, is overwhelming. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations">The United Nations</a> itself has said that repeatedly. This is not an assertion of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> or of the United States; it is the central part of resolution 1441. I know that my hon. Friend subscribes very strongly to the United Nations and places faith in it. The third paragraph of the resolution states that the United Nations recognises</p> <p class="indent" pid=".1065.1/2">"the threat <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> non-compliance with Council resolutions and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles poses to international peace and security."</p> <p pid=".1065.1/3">That is the truth; that is what we are dealing with. It is <span class="hi">Iraq</span> that was found guilty 12 years ago and it has to prove its innocence, given the guilt that was plainly found in 1991.</p> <p pid=".1065.1/4">On the nuclear weapons programme, the absence of evidence in a huge country where there are only 100 inspectors does not prove the absence of a programme. What we must then look at is the other circumstantial evidence. We must look at the fact that, in 1991, it turned out that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had a nuclear programme that was so highly developed that it would have been able to launch nuclear weapons within three years.</p></div>

The documents were found not in filing cabinets in an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Ministry_of_Defence">Iraqi Ministry of Defence</a> establishment marked "nuclear weapons programme", but in the private home of an Iraqi scientist. We would have found it odd if that had happened in this country and I believe that my hon. Friend would have found it so too.</p> <p pid=".1065.3/2">Finally, I say to my hon. Friend—I do not believe that he is naive, but I am anxious to protect him from that charge—that it is also worth bearing in mind the fact that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> said for four years that there was no evidence whatever of any biological weapons programme. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> said that it was absolutely untrue that such a programme existed and the inspectors could not find any evidence. As my hon. Friend is not naive, I know that he would not have stood up and said, "Therefore, the programme does not exist." That would have been very wise, as it took the defection of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law to spill the beans and reveal that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had the most terrifying programme. We know about this man. We know that he is not only a liar, but a man who has amassed terrible weapons to destroy his own people and the region.

It has been anticipated by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> and by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> in an important speech that he made in Cincinnati late last year. I do not think that anybody in the House, on any side of the argument, has any brief for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, but the objective of resolution 1441 was to secure his disarmament, hopefully by peaceful means. What President Bush said—I endorse these words entirely—is that if there was full and peaceful disarmament by Saddam Hussein, the nature of his regime would change. That is true. In any event, the objective is peaceful disarmament and Saddam Hussein has it in his hands to disarm peacefully and survive. I would not like the latter, but it would be an acceptable consequence of his full compliance with the will of the United Nations. That is why it is absolutely true when we say that he has a real choice. I hope that, even at this late stage, he exercises it.</p></div>

The Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> told the studio audience that the only narrow circumstances in which the United Kingdom would proceed to military action outwith a second resolution were those in which there was a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> in the Security Council that was subject to an unreasonable veto. It now seems that even that position has changed. Does the Foreign Secretary realise the hopeless position of going to war in the name of the United Nations without its full authority?</p></div>

I know that she feels strongly about this matter, but others are entitled to take a different view and feel just as strongly. I do my best, as I always have done in this House, accurately to reflect and summarise documents that we are discussing. It is impossible to read the reports of Dr. el-Baradei and Dr. Blix without concluding that they show in terms that I have already quoted that there has not been the active co-operation that was sought by resolution 1441—a lack of co-operation that goes back 12 years. I say to her that no one is exaggerating the problem and no one has invented the fact that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had the programme. Until it proves otherwise—the onus is on it to do so and the evidence suggests the reverse—it looks as though it continues to have the programme. We owe it to our own people, but even more to the people of the region, to eliminate that danger before it is too late.</p></div>

Friends who raised the issue of what has been described as the "dodgy document", and said that it had nothing to do with the threats to Heathrow and elsewhere. Last week, the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> told us—the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> reiterated this a few minutes ago—that there were clear links between the Iraqi regime and international terrorism. Yesterday, the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> referred only to the compassionate reasons for dealing with the Iraqi regime, namely to release the Iraqi people from the situation that they are in. Today, the Foreign Secretary's statement has, quite rightly, concentrated on resolution 1441 and the resolutions that have gone before it. Given all this, is it surprising that the British people are becoming more and more confused by the different messages coming from the Government, and that they do not fully understand the reasons for our being on the verge of entering into a military conflict? It is not that people are wholly opposed to it; they simply do not understand, because they are confused by the messages coming from the Government.</p></div>

When they hear the arguments, they are convinced of the need for dealing with the issue in the way in which my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1062" title="Our page on Stephen McCabe - &#39;the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe)&#39;">Mr. McCabe</a> has just spelled out. On the other point that <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=991" title="Our page on Michael Jack - &#39;the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack)&#39;">Mr. Jack</a> raised, there has been very active co-operation between the intelligence agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the weapons inspectors. I shall not go into detail about that, but there is always a difficult judgment to make about whether any intelligence should be given publicity, because its source could be extinguished immediately. We also had to be very careful, in the initial stages, about the degree of intelligence sharing, to ensure that it was done on a secure basis. It has been there, however, and it continues. I do not believe that either of the chief weapons inspectors has any complaint about the level or degree of intelligence sharing with them.</p></div>

However, as we know from world history, on occasions it is essential to enforce law by force; otherwise the world becomes extremely dangerous.</p></div>
