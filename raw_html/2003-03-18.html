That is the democracy that is our right, but that others struggle for in vain. Again, I say that I do not disrespect the views in <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to mine. This is a tough choice indeed, but it is also a stark one: to stand British troops down now and turn back, or to hold firm to the course that we have set. I believe passionately that we must hold firm to that course. The question most often posed is not "Why does it matter?" but "Why does it matter so much?" Here we are, the Government, with their most serious test, their <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> at risk, the first <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> resignation over an issue of policy, the main parties internally divided, people who agree on everything else—[Hon. Members: "The main parties?"] Ah, yes, of course. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Democrats">The Liberal Democrats</a>—unified, as ever, in opportunism and error. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p> <p pid=".760.3/4">The country and the Parliament reflect each other. This is a debate that, as time has gone on, has become less bitter but no less grave. So why does it matter so much? Because the outcome of this issue will now determine more than the fate of the Iraqi regime and more than the future of the Iraqi people who have been brutalised by Saddam for so long, important though those issues are. It will determine the way in which Britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century, the development of the United Nations, the relationship between Europe and the United States, the relations within the European Union and the way in which the United States engages with the rest of the world. So it could hardly be more important. It will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation.</p> <p pid=".760.3/5">First, let us recap the history of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and weapons of mass destruction. In April 1991, after the Gulf war, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was given 15 days to provide a full and final declaration of all its weapons of mass destruction. Saddam had used the weapons against Iran and against his own people, causing thousands of deaths. He had had plans to use them against allied forces. It became clear, after the Gulf war, that <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD">WMD</a> ambitions were far more extensive than had hitherto been thought. So the issue was identified by the United Nations at that time as one for urgent remedy. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCOM">UNSCOM</a>, the weapons inspection team, was set up. It was expected to complete its task, following the declaration, at the end of April 1991. The declaration, when it came, was false: a blanket denial of the programme, other than in a very tentative form. And so the 12-year game began.</p> <p pid=".760.3/6">The inspectors probed. Finally, in March 1992, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> admitted that it had previously undeclared weapons of mass destruction, but it said that it had destroyed them. It gave another full and final declaration. Again the inspectors probed. In October 1994, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> stopped co-operating with the weapons inspectors altogether. Military action was threatened. Inspections resumed. In March 1996, in an effort to rid <span class="hi">Iraq</span> of the inspectors, a further full and final declaration of WMD was made. By July 1996, however, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was forced to admit that declaration, too, was false.</p> <p pid=".760.3/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_August">In August</a>, it provided yet another full and final declaration. Then, a week later, Saddam's son-in-law, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_Kamal">Hussein Kamal</a>, defected to Jordan. He disclosed a far more extensive biological weapons programme and, for the first time, said that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had weaponised the programme—something that Saddam had always strenuously denied. All this had been happening while the inspectors were in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".760.3/8">Kamal also revealed <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> crash programme to produce a nuclear weapon in the 1990s. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was then forced to release documents that showed just how extensive those programmes were. In November 1996, Jordan intercepted prohibited components for missiles that could be used for weapons of mass destruction. Then a further "full and final declaration" was made. That, too, turned out to be false.</p> <p pid=".760.3/9">In June 1997, inspectors were barred from specific sites. In September 1997, lo and behold, yet another "full and final declaration" was made—also false. Meanwhile, the inspectors discovered <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a> nerve agent production equipment, the existence of which had always been denied by the Iraqis.</p> <p pid=".760.3/10">In October 1997, the United States and the United Kingdom threatened military action if <span class="hi">Iraq</span> refused to comply with the inspectors. Finally, under threat of action in February 1998, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> went to Baghdad and negotiated a memorandum with Saddam to allow inspections to continue. They did continue, for a few months. In August, co-operation was suspended.</p> <p pid=".760.3/11">In December, the inspectors left. Their final report is a withering indictment of Saddam's lies, deception and obstruction, with large quantities of weapons of mass destruction unaccounted for. Then, in December 1998, the US and the UK undertook <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Fox">Desert Fox</a>, a targeted bombing campaign to degrade as much of the Iraqi WMD facility as we could.</p> <p pid=".760.3/12"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_1999">In 1999</a>, a new inspection team, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a>, was set up. Saddam refused to allow those inspectors even to enter <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. So there they stayed, in limbo, until, after resolution 1441 last November, they were allowed to return.</p> <p pid=".760.3/13">That is the history—and what is the claim of Saddam today? Why, exactly the same as before: that he has no weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, we are asked to believe that after seven years of obstruction and non-compliance, finally resulting in the inspectors' leaving in 1998—seven years in which he hid his programme and built it up, even when the inspectors were there in Iraq—when they had left, he voluntarily decided to do what he had consistently refused to do under coercion.</p> <p pid=".760.3/14">When the inspectors left in 1998, they left unaccounted for 10,000 litres of anthrax; a far-reaching VX nerve agent programme; up to 6,500 chemical munitions; at least 80 tonnes of mustard gas, and possibly more than 10 times that amount; unquantifiable amounts of sarin, botulinum toxin and a host of other biological poisons; and an entire Scud missile programme. We are asked now seriously to accept that in the last few years—contrary to all history, contrary to all intelligence—Saddam decided unilaterally to destroy those weapons. I say that such a claim is palpably absurd.</p> <p pid=".760.3/15">Resolution 1441 is very clear. It lays down a final opportunity for Saddam to disarm. It rehearses the fact that he has for years been in material breach of 17 UN resolutions. It says that this time compliance must be full, unconditional and immediate, the first step being a full and final declaration of all weapons of mass destruction to be given on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December</phrase> last year.</p> <p pid=".760.3/16">I will not go through all the events since then, as the House is familiar with them, but this much is accepted by all members of the UN Security Council: the <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December</phrase> declaration is false. That in itself, incidentally, is a material breach. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has taken some steps in co-operation, but no one disputes that it is not fully co-operating. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> continues to deny that it has any weapons of mass destruction, although no serious intelligence service anywhere in the world believes it.</p> <p pid=".760.3/17">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-07">7 March</phrase>, the inspectors published a remarkable document. It is 173 pages long, and details all the unanswered questions about <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> weapons of mass destruction. It lists 29 different areas in which the inspectors have been unable to obtain information. On VX, for example, it says:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".760.3/18">"Documentation available to UNMOVIC suggests that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> at least had had far reaching plans to weaponise VX".</p> <p pid=".760.3/19">On mustard gas, it says:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".760.3/20">"Mustard constituted an important part . . . of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW">CW</a> arsenal . . . 550 mustard filled shells and up to 450 mustard filled aerial bombs unaccounted for . . . additional uncertainty" with respect to over 6,500 aerial bombs,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".760.3/22">"corresponding to approximately 1,000 tonnes of agent, predominantly mustard."</p> <p pid=".760.3/23">On biological weapons, the inspectors' report states:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".760.3/24">"Based on unaccounted for growth media, <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> potential production of anthrax could have been in the range of about 15,000 to 25,000 litres . . . Based on all the available evidence, the strong presumption is that about 10,000 litres of anthrax was not destroyed and may still exist."</p> <p pid=".760.3/25">On that basis, I simply say to the House that, had we meant what we said in resolution 1441, the Security Council should have convened and condemned <span class="hi">Iraq</span> as in material breach. What is perfectly clear is that Saddam is playing the same old games in the same old way. Yes, there are minor concessions, but there has been no fundamental change of heart or mind.</p> <p pid=".760.3/26">However, after <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-07">7 March</phrase>, the inspectors said that there was at least some co-operation, and the world rightly hesitated over war. Let me now describe to the House what then took place.</p> <p pid=".760.3/27">We therefore approached a second resolution in this way. As I said, we could have asked for the second resolution then and there, because it was justified. Instead, we laid down an ultimatum calling upon Saddam to come into line with resolution 1441, or be in material breach. That is not an unreasonable proposition, given the history, but still countries hesitated. They asked, "How do we judge what is full co-operation?"</p> <p pid=".760.3/28">So we then worked on a further compromise. We consulted the inspectors and drew up five tests, based on the document that they published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-07">7 March</phrase>. Those tests included allowing interviews with 30 scientists to be held outside <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, and releasing details of the production of the anthrax, or at least of the documentation showing what had happened to it. The inspectors added another test: that Saddam should publicly call on Iraqis to co-operate with them.</p> <p pid=".760.3/29">So we constructed this framework: that Saddam should be given a specified time to fulfil all six tests to show full co-operation; and that, if he did so, the inspectors could then set out a forward work programme that would extend over a period of time to make sure that disarmament happened. However, if Saddam failed to meet those tests to judge compliance, action would follow.</p> <p pid=".760.3/30">So there were clear benchmarks, plus a clear ultimatum. Again, I defy anyone to describe that as an unreasonable proposition.</p> <p pid=".760.3/31">Last Monday, we were getting very close with it. We very nearly had the majority agreement. If I might, I should particularly like to thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Chile">President of Chile</a> for the constructive way in which he approached this issue.</p> <p pid=".760.3/32">Yes, there were debates about the length of the ultimatum, but the basic construct was gathering support. Then, on Monday night, France said that it would veto a second resolution, whatever the circumstances. Then France denounced the six tests. Later that day, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> rejected them. Still, we continued to negotiate, even at that point.</p> <p pid=".760.3/33">Last Friday, France said that it could not accept any resolution with an ultimatum in it. On Monday, we made final efforts to secure agreement. However, the fact is that France remains utterly opposed to anything that lays down an ultimatum authorising action in the event of non-compliance by Saddam.</p></div>

Those on the Security Council opposed to us say that they want Saddam to disarm, but they will not countenance any new resolution that authorises force in the event of non-compliance. That is their position—no to any ultimatum and no to any resolution that stipulates that failure to comply will lead to military action. So we must demand that Saddam disarms, but relinquish any concept of a threat if he does not.</p> <p pid=".764.3/2">From December 1998 to December 2002, no UN inspector was allowed to inspect anything in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. For four years, no inspection took place. What changed Saddam's mind was the threat of force. From December to January, and then from January through to February, some concessions were made. What changed his mind? It was the threat of force. What makes him now issue invitations to the inspectors, discover documents that he said he never had, produce evidence of weapons supposed to be non-existent, and destroy missiles he said he would keep? It is the imminence of force. The only persuasive power to which he responds is 250,000 allied troops on his doorstep. However, when that fact is so obvious, we are told that any resolution that authorises force in the event of non-compliance will be vetoed—not just opposed, but vetoed and blocked.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".765.2/1">We can argue about each one of those vetoes in the past and whether they were reasonable, but I define an unreasonable veto as follows. In resolution 1441, we said that it was Saddam's final opportunity and that he had to comply. That was agreed by all members of the Security Council. What is surely unreasonable is for a country to come forward now, at the very point when we might reach agreement and when we are—not unreasonably—saying that he must comply with the UN, after all these months without full compliance, on the basis of the six tests or action will follow. For that country to say that it will veto such a resolution in all circumstances is what I would call unreasonable.</p> <p pid=".765.2/2">The tragedy is that the world has to learn the lesson all over again that weakness in the face of a threat from a tyrant is the surest way not to peace, but—unfortunately—to conflict. Looking back over those 12 years, the truth is that we have been victims of our own desire to placate the implacable, to persuade towards reason the utterly unreasonable, and to hope that there was some genuine intent to do good in a regime whose mind is in fact evil.</p> <p pid=".765.2/3">Now the very length of time counts against us. People say, "You've waited 12 years, so why not wait a little longer?" Of course we have done so, because resolution 1441 gave a final opportunity. As I have just pointed out, the first test was on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December</phrase>. But still we waited. We waited for the inspectors' reports. We waited as each concession was tossed to us to whet our appetite for hope and further waiting. But still no one, not even today at the Security Council, says that Saddam is co-operating fully, unconditionally or immediately.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".767.0/1">First, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely wrong about the position on resolution 1441. It is correct that resolution 1441 did not say that there would be another resolution authorising the use of force, but the implication of resolution 1441—it was stated in terms—was that if <span class="hi">Iraq</span> continued in material breach, defined as not co-operating fully, immediately and unconditionally, serious consequences should follow. All we are asking for in the second resolution is the clear ultimatum that if Saddam continues to fail to co-operate, force should be used. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French">The French</a> position is that France will vote no, whatever the circumstances. Those are not my words, but those of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_President">French President</a>. I find it sad that at this point in time he cannot support us in the position we have set out, which is the only sure way to disarm Saddam. And what, indeed, would any tyrannical regime possessing weapons of mass destruction think when viewing the history of the world's diplomatic dance with Saddam over these 12 years? That our capacity to pass firm resolutions has only been matched by our feebleness in implementing them. That is why this indulgence has to stop—because it is dangerous: dangerous if such regimes disbelieve us; dangerous if they think they can use our weakness, our hesitation, and even the natural urges of our democracy towards peace against us; and dangerous because one day they will mistake our innate revulsion against war for permanent incapacity, when, in fact, if pushed to the limit, we will act. But when we act, after years of pretence, the action will have to be harder, bigger, more total in its impact. It is true that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is not the only country with weapons of mass destruction, but I say this to the House: back away from this confrontation now, and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects.</p> <p pid=".767.0/2">Of course, in a sense, any fair observer does not really dispute that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is in breach of resolution 1441 or that it implies action in such circumstances. The real problem is that, underneath, people dispute that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is a threat, dispute the link between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and dispute, in other words, the whole basis of our assertion that the two together constitute a fundamental assault on our way of life.</p> <p pid=".767.0/3">There are glib and sometimes foolish comparisons with the 1930s. I am not suggesting for a moment that anyone here is an appeaser or does not share our revulsion at the regime of Saddam. However, there is one relevant point of analogy. It is that, with history, we know what happened. We can look back and say, "There's the time; that was the moment; that's when we should have acted." However, the point is that it was not clear at the time—not at that moment. In fact, at that time, many people thought such a fear fanciful or, worse, that it was put forward in bad faith by warmongers. Let me read one thing from an editorial from a paper that I am pleased to say takes a different position today. It was written in late 1938 after Munich. One would have thought from the history books that people thought the world was tumultuous in its desire to act. This is what the editorial said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".767.0/4">"Be glad in your hearts. Give thanks to your God. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_Britain">People of Britain</a>, your children are safe. Your husbands and your sons will not march to war. Peace is a victory for all mankind . . . And now let us go back to our own affairs. We have had enough of those menaces, conjured up . . . to confuse us."</p> <p pid=".767.0/5">Now, of course, should Hitler again appear in the same form, we would know what to do. But the point is that history does not declare the future to us plainly. Each time is different and the present must be judged without the benefit of hindsight. So let me explain to the House why I believe that the threat that we face today is so serious and why we must tackle it. The threat today is not that of the 1930s. It is not big powers going to war with each other. The ravages that fundamentalist ideology inflicted on the 20th century are memories. The cold war is over. Europe is at peace, if not always diplomatically. But the world is ever more interdependent. Stock markets and economies rise and fall together, confidence is the key to prosperity, and insecurity spreads like contagion. The key today is stability and order. The threat is chaos and disorder—and there are two begetters of chaos: tyrannical regimes with weapons of mass destruction and extreme terrorist groups who profess a perverted and false view of Islam.</p> <p pid=".767.0/6">Let me tell the House what I know. I know that there are some countries, or groups within countries, that are proliferating and trading in weapons of mass destruction—especially nuclear weapons technology. I know that there are companies, individuals, and some former scientists on nuclear weapons programmes, who are selling their equipment or expertise. I know that there are several countries—mostly dictatorships with highly repressive regimes—that are desperately trying to acquire chemical weapons, biological weapons or, in particular, nuclear weapons capability. Some of those countries are now a short time away from having a serviceable nuclear weapon. This activity is not diminishing. It is increasing.</p> <p pid=".767.0/7">We all know that there are terrorist groups now operating in most major countries. Just in the past two years, around 20 different nations have suffered serious terrorist outrages. Thousands of people—quite apart from <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>—have died in them. The purpose of that terrorism is not just in the violent act; it is in producing terror. It sets out to inflame, to divide, and to produce consequences of a calamitous nature. Round the world, it now poisons the chances of political progress—in the middle east, in Kashmir, in Chechnya and in Africa. The removal of the Taliban—yes—dealt it a blow. But it has not gone away.</p> <p pid=".767.0/8">Those two threats have, of course, different motives and different origins, but they share one basic common view: they detest the freedom, democracy and tolerance that are the hallmarks of our way of life. At the moment, I accept fully that the association between the two is loose—but it is hardening. The possibility of the two coming together—of terrorist groups in possession of weapons of mass destruction or even of a so-called dirty radiological bomb—is now, in my judgment, a real and present danger to Britain and its national security.</p></div>

Let us recall: what was shocking about <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> was not just the slaughter of innocent people but the knowledge that, had the terrorists been able, there would have been not 3,000 innocent dead, but 30,000 or 300,000—and the more the suffering, the greater their rejoicing. I say to my hon. Friend that America did not attack the al-Qaeda terrorist group; the al-Qaeda terrorist group attacked America. They did not need to be recruited; they were there already. Unless we take action against them, they will grow. That is why we should act.</p></div>

Three kilograms of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a> from a rocket launcher would contaminate 0.25 sq km of a city. Millions of lethal doses are contained in one litre of anthrax, and 10,000 litres are unaccounted for. What happened on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> has changed the psychology of America—that is clear—but it should have changed the psychology of the world.</p> <p pid=".769.8/3">Of course, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is not the only part of this threat. I have never said that it was. But it is the test of whether we treat the threat seriously. Faced with it, the world should unite. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> should be the focus both of diplomacy and of action. That is what 1441 said. That was the deal. And I simply say to the House that to break it now, and to will the ends but not the means, would do more damage in the long term to the UN than any other single course that we could pursue. To fall back into the lassitude of the past 12 years; to talk, to discuss, to debate but never to act; to declare our will but not to enforce it; and to continue with strong language but with weak intentions—that is the worst course imaginable. If we pursue that course, when the threat returns, from <span class="hi">Iraq</span> or elsewhere, who will then believe us? What price our credibility with the next tyrant? It was interesting today that some of the strongest statements of support for allied forces came from near to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a>—from Japan and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</a>.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".770.3/1">First, let me apologise to <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1276" title="Our page on Teddy Taylor - &#39;the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor)&#39;">Sir Teddy Taylor</a>. He was making a point in my favour and I failed to spot it.</p> <p pid=".770.3/2">Secondly, to my hon. Friend, yes, I do support what the President said. Do not be in any doubt at all—Iraq has been supporting terrorist groups. For example, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is offering money to the families of suicide bombers whose purpose is to wreck any chance of progress in the middle east. Although I said that the associations were loose, they are hardening. I do believe that, and I believe that the two threats coming together are the dangers that we face in our world.</p> <p pid=".770.3/3">I also say this: there will be in any event no sound future for the United Nations—no guarantee against the repetition of these events—unless we recognise the urgent need for a political agenda that we can unite upon. What we have witnessed is indeed the consequence of Europe and the United States dividing from each other. Not all of Europe—Spain, Italy, Holland, Denmark and Portugal have strongly supported us—and not a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of Europe if we include, as we should, Europe's new members who will accede next year, all 10 of whom have been in strong support of the position of this Government. But the paralysis of the UN has been born out of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> that there is.</p> <p pid=".770.3/4">I want to deal with that in this way. At the heart of that division is the concept of a world in which there are rival poles of power, with the US and its allies in one corner and France, Germany, Russia and their allies in the other. I do not believe that all those nations intend such an outcome, but that is what now faces us. I believe such a vision to be misguided and profoundly dangerous for our world. I know why it arises. There is resentment of US predominance. There is fear of US unilateralism. People ask, "Do the US listen to us and our preoccupations?" And there is perhaps a lack of full understanding of US preoccupations after <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>. I know all this. But the way to deal with it is not rivalry, but partnership. Partners are not servants, but neither are they rivals. What Europe should have said last September to the United States is this: with one voice it should have said, "We understand your strategic anxiety over terrorism and weapons of mass destruction and we will help you meet it. We will mean what we say in any UN resolution we pass and will back it with action if Saddam fails to disarm voluntarily.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".772.3/1">Turkey has given that commitment. I have spoken to the Turkish Government, as have the President of the United States and many others. I have to say to my hon. Friend that it is clear from the conversations that I have had with people in that Kurdish autonomous zone that what they really fear above all else is the prospect of Saddam remaining in power, emboldened because we have failed to remove him.</p> <p pid=".772.3/2">I have never put the justification for action as regime change. We have to act within the terms set out in resolution 1441—that is our legal base. But it is the reason why I say frankly that if we do act, we should do so with a clear conscience and a strong heart. I accept fully that those who are opposed to this course of action share my detestation of Saddam. Who could not? <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is a potentially wealthy country which in 1979, the year before Saddam came to power, was richer than Portugal or Malaysia. Today it is impoverished, with 60 per cent. of its population dependent on food aid. Thousands of children die needlessly every year from lack of food and medicine. Four million people out of a population of just over 20 million are living in exile.</p> <p pid=".772.3/3">The brutality of the repression—the death and torture camps, the barbaric prisons for political opponents, the routine beatings for anyone or their families suspected of disloyalty—is well documented. Just last week, someone slandering Saddam was tied to a lamp post in a street in Baghdad, their tongue was cut out, and they were mutilated and left to bleed to death as a warning to others. I recall a few weeks ago talking to an Iraqi exile and saying to her that I understood how grim it must be under the lash of Saddam. "But you don't", she replied. "You cannot. You do not know what it is like to live in perpetual fear." And she is right. We take our freedom for granted. But imagine what it must be like not to be able to speak or discuss or debate or even question the society you live in. To see friends and family taken away and never daring to complain. To suffer the humility of failing courage in face of pitiless terror. That is how the Iraqi people live. Leave Saddam in place, and the blunt truth is that that is how they will continue to be forced to live.</p> <p pid=".772.3/4">We must face the consequences of the actions that we advocate. For those of us who support the course that I am advocating, that means all the dangers of war. But for others who are opposed to this course, it means—let us be clear—that for the Iraqi people, whose only true hope lies in the removal of Saddam, the darkness will simply close back over. They will be left under his rule, without any possibility of liberation—not from us, not from anyone.</p></div>

If our plea is for America to work with others, to be good as well as powerful allies, will our retreat make it multilateralist, or will it not rather be the biggest impulse to unilateralism that we could possibly imagine? What then of the United Nations, and of the future of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and the middle east peace process, devoid of our influence and stripped of our insistence?</p> <p pid=".773.3/2">The House wanted this discussion before conflict. That was a legitimate demand. It has it, and these are the choices. In this dilemma, no choice is perfect, no choice is ideal, but on this decision hangs the fate of many things: of whether we summon the strength to recognise the global challenge of the 21st century, and meet it; of the Iraqi people, groaning under years of dictatorship; of our armed forces, brave men and women of whom we can feel proud, and whose morale is high and whose purpose is clear; of the institutions and alliances that will shape our world for years to come. To retreat now, I believe, would put at hazard all that we hold dearest. To turn the United Nations back into a talking shop; to stifle the first steps of progress in the middle east; to leave the Iraqi people to the mercy of events over which we would have relinquished all power to influence for the better; to tell our allies that at the very moment of action, at the very moment when they need our determination, Britain faltered: I will not be party to such a course.</p> <p pid=".773.3/3">This is not the time to falter. This is the time not just for this Government—or, indeed, for this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>—but for this House to give a lead: to show that we will stand up for what we know to be right; to show that we will confront the tyrannies and dictatorships and terrorists who put our way of life at risk; to show, at the moment of decision, that we have the courage to do the right thing.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".774.0/1">The House and the whole country rightly recognise that we are soon likely to be at war. It is a solemn moment in the life of our nation, and our first thoughts and prayers today must be with our troops and their families as they prepare for action. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> recognise the heavy responsibility that the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the Government have to bear. I remind the House that the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s decision comes at the end of 12 years of what was too often indecision by the international community.</p> <p pid=".774.0/2">I make it clear from the outset that the official Opposition will vote tonight in the same Lobby as the Government. In saying that, I recognise that there are honestly felt and genuinely carried differences of view on both sides of the House about further military action in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. I respect those unreservedly, wherever they are held, and I recognise that they reflect strong differences of view that are felt throughout the country. However, given the differences and the difficulties that they have posed for the Government in general and for the Prime Minister in particular, I say frankly to the House that the official Opposition could somehow have sought to manoeuvre themselves into the No Lobby tonight. After all, we have argued consistently that Ministers have failed to convince the public of their case, and we have sought to hold the Government to account in the House for their mistakes. In particular, we have also pointed out the failures with regard to the humanitarian consequences of war. However, I believe that when the Government do the right thing by the British people, they deserve the support of the House, and particularly of the main Opposition.</p> <p pid=".774.0/3">Certain issues need to be taken head-on today. The idea that this action would become a recruiting sergeant for others to come to the colours of those who are "anti" any nation in the west is, I am afraid, nonsense. The biggest recruiting sergeant of all has been indecision, and the failure to take action to show that such resolve matters.</p> <p pid=".774.0/4">There are well-held views that I have respect for, but as I said, we could have sought a way to do something that would have damaged the Government. I understand that the Liberal Democrats will do just that tonight. They are, of course, entitled to their view, but I simply say this to them. One can argue that further military action by our armed forces would be illegal, or that it should be supported. But a political party surely cannot simultaneously argue that military action is illegal but should none the less be supported somehow. Yet that, we gather, is what the Liberal Democrats plan to put as their main case tonight. What is clear is that one cannot have it both ways; one has to make a decision and lead.</p> <p pid=".774.0/5">We are voting tonight in support of the motion not because we endorse every detail of the Prime Minister's handling of the matter, certainly not because we are eager for conflict—as the House knows, I served in the armed forces, and I have some knowledge of the horror of the aftermath of conflict—and not just because we want to show our support for our troops. That said, I believe firmly that, as the Prime Minister says, they are entitled to our full support today.</p> <p pid=".774.0/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> is a tyrant who tortures and murders his own people. He poses a threat to the safety and stability of the middle east, and he is in complete breach of his obligations to the United Nations and to the international community. However, the main reason why we will be voting for the motion is that it is in the British national interest. Saddam Hussein has the means, the mentality and the motive to pose a direct threat to our national security. That is why we will be voting tonight to do the right thing by our troops and the British people.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".775.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful case for supporting the Government's motion tonight, and I expect that he will be in the Lobby in support.</p> <p pid=".775.2/2">The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> rightly pointed out that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> has lied to the UN for 12 years. Even now, we do not know the full extent of his arsenal, or of his facilities to develop weapons. He has the means, and as has already been said, it should be evident to everyone that he remains in breach of the obligations under 1441. He has absolutely no intention whatsoever of relinquishing the weapons that he has developed: the remaining al-Samoud 2 missiles; the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scud-B">Scud-B</a> warheads; the R-400 bombs; and the tonnes of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a>, anthrax, sarin, soman, botulinum toxin, mustard gas and other deadly weapons, viruses and agents identified by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> in his report, which I recommend that every Member of this House read before passing judgment.</p> <p pid=".775.2/3">Saddam Hussein has not only the means but the mentality. To date, his main victims have been his own people. The tale of his rule of lawlessness is a litany of horror. Dissident women are raped, children are tortured and prisoners are trapped in steel boxes until they confess or die. As we have heard, chemical weapons have been used against the Kurds, and Shi'a villages razed to the ground. As the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said, when Saddam Hussein came to power, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was a wealthy country: today, it is impoverished.</p> <p pid=".775.2/4">If that was not enough, Saddam Hussein is also the man who has waged war against Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Here in Britain, where we are at liberty to protest against any military action, we should recall—as the Prime Minister said—that such liberty does not exist for those who live in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and whose tongues are ripped out if they dare to question Saddam Hussein.</p> <p pid=".775.2/5">When I had the privilege of visiting our troops in Kuwait, I also had the opportunity of talking to the families of 600 Kuwaiti prisoners of war, taken by Saddam Hussein at the time of the last Gulf war and still missing. I recall talking to one old man whose last sight of his son was when he was being taken away by Iraqi soldiers. He has never been returned. There is no documentary evidence of the existence of those 600 people. Inspection of the prisons is not allowed. At no time has Saddam Hussein agreed to independent inspectors telling their families what happened to them.</p> <p pid=".775.2/6">Some may say that 600 people do not matter in the great scheme of things, but the equivalent percentage in our population would mean that 60,000 British people were missing. How many Members would not consider that a matter of massive importance and a sign of the distinct distastefulness of that regime?</p> <p pid=".775.2/7">There is a huge and powerful argument to act. Saddam Hussein is in breach not only on weapons but also in personal terms for those who live and have to suffer under his regime. It is well worth meeting the dissidents and I advise all Members to do so. Their tales about what has happened to their families are harrowing. One man told me that he last saw his brother 18 years ago as he was being taken away for a minor traffic offence. His brother has never been seen again. I promise that no one will shed a tear over the departure of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p pid=".775.2/8">Saddam Hussein has the means and the mentality. He also has the motive. We in Britain helped to expel him from Kuwait. For more than 10 years, British forces have been enforcing the no-fly zones. We are a crucial part of the coalition that seeks to force UN resolutions upon his regime. The threat that his arsenal poses to British citizens at home and abroad cannot simply be contained. Whether in the hands of his regime or in the hands of the terrorists to whom he would give his weapons, they pose a clear danger to British citizens. To those who doubt that, I point out that only the other day Saddam said that he would strike anywhere,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".775.2/9">"by land, sea or sky".</p> <p pid=".775.2/10">Those who believe otherwise are living in cloud cuckoo land. The reality for them, as for others, is that Britain and its citizens are as much prime targets as anybody in the world.</p> <p pid=".775.2/11">As the Prime Minister said, Saddam's last hope lies in his ability to string along the international community for as long as possible. People who say that another month and a half would be all right and that it is only a small delay should realise that, in another month and a half, any military action will become nigh on impossible. The delay would not be for a month and a half but would have to last until the autumn, and in the meantime, Saddam's prevarications and games will split the international community and wreck the UN. The blame for further military action lies squarely in the hands of Saddam Hussein. It is his regime only that has made further military action necessary, yet, even now, he has the power to ensure that such action does not take place.</p> <p pid=".775.2/12">It would be wrong for us not to acknowledge the consequences of that military action. I am sad to say that the Iraqi people may have to suffer yet again, but I hope and believe that, in the decision that the Prime Minister has to take, the suffering of the Iraqi people will be short-lived and that the ultimate end will be peace and security in their country.</p> <p pid=".775.2/13">That is why the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> have constantly urged the Government to set out their plans for humanitarian assistance. Our view of the lack of preparedness was endorsed by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on International Development, which warned last week of concern about the "lack of leadership" in co-ordinating the planning and preparation of the humanitarian response to possible military action. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> also recommended that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_International_Development">Department for International Development</a></p> <p class="indent" pid=".775.2/14">"immediately issues a statement outlining its basic humanitarian contingency plans".</p> <p pid=".775.2/15">We welcome the written statement made last week by the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for International Development, but it did not explain what is being done to improve co-ordination between the Ministry of Defence and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFID">DFID</a>. It did not establish whether DFID would set up a mechanism to co-ordinate the UK humanitarian response. It did not set out what will replace the oil-for-food programme, which feeds up to 60 per cent. of the Iraqi population. It did not spell out DFID's plans in the event of Saddam Hussein unleashing any of his arsenal of chemical and biological weapons on his own people. Nor did it give details of how to cope with the flight of refugees. Those are pressing questions, as it is estimated that up to a million people may seek refuge on the borders. The questions need to be answered.</p></div>

What happened in Halabja was an outrage and should be condemned by everyone regardless of their views.</p> <p pid=".778.3/2">We remain committed to the right of Israel to exist behind secure and legally accepted borders, as the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said, with binding guarantees of peace from its Arab neighbours, but hon. Members on both sides of the House are equally committed to the cessation of settlement activity and the establishment of a Palestinian state on the west bank. We are firmly of the view that Israel must withdraw from the occupied territories and believe that now is the time for the Government fully to embrace the process, as the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> laid it out.</p> <p pid=".778.3/3">There are welcome indications that the road map will be published soon, paving the way for a full and comprehensive settlement, and we realise that the Muslim world is looking to the implementation of that road map as a way forward that is coherent and consistent. It is imperative to all those committed to that road map now to prove their commitment to it during the months ahead, and I am assured that the Prime Minister will do just that.</p> <p pid=".778.3/4">The House knows that I have long held the view that Saddam Hussein is a threat to our national interest and that, if decisive action had been taken earlier, we would not now stand on the verge of war, but all that lies in the past, for we are entering the final phase of a 12-year history in relation to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_17">The 17</a> resolutions passed since then have put Saddam Hussein under 27 separate obligations, and resolution 1441 gave him a final opportunity to meet those obligations or face the serious consequences named. More than 18 weeks have passed since he was given that final choice. More than 600 weeks have passed since he was given the first chance when the UN first entered Baghdad.</p> <p pid=".778.3/5">I acknowledge that other hon. Members oppose further military action and some have general doubts and concerns, but I genuinely urge them all to consider the consequences of turning back now. In turning back, we would widen splits in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>, stir up isolationism in the United States and abandon our allies in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Australia and many countries in eastern Europe, where people know what it is like to live under tyranny and have supported the actions of the Prime Minister and others.</p> <p pid=".778.3/6">Above all, we would strip the UN of its authority, betray our own national interest and send an unmistakable signal to Saddam Hussein and every rogue state and terrorist group in the world that we lack the will to enforce just demands against those tyrannical regimes. That is the road that France would have us go down, and we must not take that road.</p> <p pid=".778.3/7">There are matters at stake that rise above party politics. It is the duty of the Government to act in <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a>, and it is the duty of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> to support them when they do so. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> is acting in the national interest today. That is why he is entitled to our support in doing the right thing. This is a critical moment for the House. If we vote to give Saddam yet another chance, the moment will pass, our concentration will falter, our energy and our focus will disperse and our nerve will fail, with disastrous consequences for us all.</p> <p pid=".778.3/8">We cannot funk this challenge and leave it for future generations. We cannot heap up the problems at their door and leave them to face the consequences. We must not deprive our troops of the support that they fully deserve from all quarters of the House. We must shoulder our responsibilities and seize that moment. If we <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a> now, our failure will be used as a club against us in years to come. We should stand firm, act and show that we have learned from past failures. For the sake of our security and that of the wider world, I urge the House to vote for the motion tonight.</p></div>

Indeed, it is an issue that transcends many normal ties of party, friendship and even family because the outcomes of the decisions that will be taken here and elsewhere will be so tremendous. As the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> says, those decisions will set the tone for a very long time to come.</p> <p pid=".779.2/4">It would be remiss of me if I did not pick up a number of the points that the Prime Minister made in his speech if only to point out that he is rightly credited with being a man of conviction, but so are other right hon. and hon. Members, and with their convictions and their examination of the facts as opposed to the collection of assertions, value judgments and interpretations that seem to make up the Government's case, they seem to draw very different conclusions.</p> <p pid=".779.2/5">For example, the Prime Minister made much of events back in 1938. Of course, he said that he was not suggesting that anyone was an appeaser. The only person whom I have ever appeased in my life is Mrs. Kilfoyle—not very successfully, I hasten to add. The thing that struck me, of course, was that I do not recall that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations">League of Nations</a> had inspectors in Germany dismantling the panzers in 1938, as we have inspectors dismantling the weapons in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> today.</p> <p pid=".779.2/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> rightly made much of the dangers of terrorism, but does that not illustrate the idiocy of fighting the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time against the wrong enemy? We are having a 19th-century gunboat war in the Gulf when the real dangers of terrorism should be isolated and dealt with as the first priority. I accept the argument that those things run concurrently, but I do not accept the linkage that is often made. The Prime Minister said that the linkage is loose, but that it is hardening. He will have privileged information that we are not privy to, but nevertheless the one thing that I can guarantee will harden that linkage is the manifest failure to deal with the underlying causes that have given us the terrorism and the situation in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> in the first place.</p> <p pid=".779.2/7">I note the fact that the Government motion refers to the road map—a road map that was torpedoed within 24 hours by Prime Minister Sharon's insistence that he would not accept a Palestinian state.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".780.1/1">No. I am sorry, but I have only eight minutes.</p> <p pid=".780.1/2">The fourth issue that struck me was the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s comment that the US had a preoccupation after 9/11, which changed its world view. The US may have that preoccupation, but the Administration had set out their view long in advance of being an Administration. I refer the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to the parliamentary record, which will show references to the letter written to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Clinton">President Clinton</a> in 1998 by the Project for a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_American_Century">New American Century</a> in which it set out very clearly what its intentions were and urged President Clinton to mount an attack on <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".780.1/3">Those of us who have put our names to the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> have done so not with any sense of mischief making or because we do not recognise that those on the other side of the argument hold very sincere views, but because we are conscious of our interpretation of what is said. My own interpretation is that this act would be illegal, immoral and illogical. The Government will tell us that the selected evidence from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> that has been published has satisfied the Government and ought to satisfy the House, but I prefer to take the views of the many eminent jurists who have reached very different conclusions. And yes, I also accept the view set out by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> that the international community needed a second resolution. I am satisfied that, without that second resolution, we are getting into extremely dangerous ground and setting extremely dangerous precedents.</p> <p pid=".780.1/4">It is immoral because in waging this war—we should think about what the term awe and shock implies—the United States is aiming to put in 10 times as many missiles and precision bombs in the first 48 hours as it committed in the whole of the last Gulf war. That is against a country that has been decimated year after year. Regardless of the rights and wrongs, the fact is that an already destroyed, effectively third-world country will be further damaged. It seems to me grossly immoral to talk about the reconstruction of damage that one has wilfully caused.</p> <p pid=".780.1/5">It is illogical because, as I intimated a moment ago, we are going after the wrong enemy at the wrong time and in the wrong way. I do not believe that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> has been anything other than contained. I do not believe any assertion that is made without the evidence being provided that there are linkages between him and al-Qaeda. I do not believe that he has had the wherewithal, or would have it, to be able to attack the United Kingdom directly. There has been an awful lot of scaremongering that does not add to the Government's case.</p> <p pid=".780.1/6">I am conscious that I am running out of time. I have mentioned once before in the House the advice that was given by Archidamus to his Spartan allies. He said that slow and cautious may be seen as wise and sensible. Many years later, the Athenian superpower, in its impatience, found out that he was absolutely right: impatience had imperilled it and led to its destruction. I say earnestly and honestly to the Government: their impatience will reap a whirlwind, which will affect us and ours for generations to come. I urge hon. Members to support the amendment.</p></div>

In the previous debate, the right hon. Gentleman made a powerful contribution to that cross-party basis, which needs to be heard and discussed rationally today.</p> <p pid=".781.0/2">Although it is sad that we have lost a very good <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a>, there is no doubt, having listened to his brilliant resignation statement in the House yesterday evening, that those of us who are supporting the cross-party <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> in the Lobby tonight, as I and my right hon. and hon. Friends will do, have gained a powerful additional advocate for the case that we are sincerely making. Given the events of the past few days and the last few hours, there has been much understandable comment about the drama of the situation. In the next few hours and days, however, we are liable to see even more drama and trauma when what appears to be the inevitable military conflict against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> begins. Let us hope, as we all agree, that the conflict can be conducted as swiftly as possible, with the minimum of casualties: first and foremost, clearly, among our forces, but equally among innocent Iraqi civilians, with whom none of us has ever had any quarrel and who have suffered terribly under the despicable regime of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>.</p> <p pid=".781.0/3">As for those of us who remain unpersuaded as to the case at this time for war, and who have questioned whether British forces should be sent into a war without a further UN mandate having been achieved, there stands no contradiction—as the former Leader of the House and former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> put succinctly last night—between giving voice to that legitimate anxiety and, at the same time, as and when exchange of fire commences, looking to the rest of the country, and to all of us in the House, to give full moral support to our forces. They do not take the civilian political decision in relation to what they are being asked to do, but they must carry out that task in all our names. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> Leader of the House expressed that well last night, but, equally, Church leaders, who earlier expressed profound <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to war in this way at this time, are making the same point. If, later tonight, at the conclusion of this debate, under the democratic procedures that we enjoy in this House, that is to be the decision, it is important that the whole House unites in that genuine support.</p></div>

Members to raise legitimate questions, as many have in all parties, on the supply and suitability of equipment, the eventual war aims, the participation of British forces and the bombs that might be used. It would be right to ask whether we would desist from resorting to cluster bombs or depleted uranium. It would also be right to ask about the longer term role that we hope British forces will play, if the war ensues, in the humanitarian and reconstruction roles on which they have such a distinguished track record. That is why we have supported the UN route, and it will be a source of great regret if the motion is passed because British troops will be put into action.</p> <p pid=".784.15/2">There are, however, two specific things on which the Government are right to expect and deserve significant credit over the course of the past six months. The first is that they were instrumental in persuading a reluctant United States to go down the UN route. Everything that I have been party to and privy to over the past six months persuades me that that is the case. The second is that the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> and other senior colleagues have been consistent in emphasising to the Americans and others the primary need to re-establish a meaningful middle east peace process.</p></div>

Let us face it, having taken the decision to abandon the UN route, the sudden embrace of the middle east peace process with refreshed urgency arouses the suspicion among many that the two are not unconnected and, perhaps, that if they are willing to do one, they may be willing to abandon the other or to go lukewarm at a later stage.</p></div>

It is best summed up by the words used by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> over the past few days. In the absence of a further explicit United Nations resolution, which is obviously the position in which we find ourselves, he remarked last week:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".785.9/2">"The legitimacy and support for any such action will be seriously impaired. If the USA and others go outside the Council and take military action it will be not be in conformity with the Charter."</p> <p pid=".785.9/3">That raises very serious questions on which we should reflect. Only yesterday afternoon, the Secretary-General said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".785.9/4">"If the action is to take place without the support of the Council, its legitimacy will be questioned" and the international support will be diminished. We are right to reflect on those considerations.</p></div>

No matter how sophisticated modern technology, even compared with at the time of the last Gulf war, is it not more precise to have weapons dismantled in the presence of inspectors rather than so-called precision bombing trying to take them out?</p> <p pid=".787.1/3">There is huge public anxiety in Britain. That is the mark of a fundamentally decent society. All of us, whatever our views, whatever our parties, know that the kind of people contacting us are very different from many of those with whom we deal regularly. They are the kind of people who say, "I have never contacted a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> before," or "I've never been politically active before." They are the kind of people who have never gone on a march or attended a vigil before. Another significant point is that, whether or not they agree with the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, only a tiny fraction ever call into question his sincerity in this matter. I have never done so and I do not do so today. But much as they detest Saddam's brutality, they are not persuaded that the case for war has been adequately made at this point, they are worried about the new doctrine of regime change, they are wary of the Bush Administration's motives, and they do not like to see Britain separated from its natural international allies.</p> <p pid=".787.1/4">The cross-party <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> is the correct amendment. It is tabled at the correct time, and, if passed, would send the correct signal. It is on those grounds that the Liberal Democrats will vote for it tonight.</p></div>

The requirement that must be placed upon him if he is to come into compliance is set out, as, glaringly, is the huge gulf between his compliance so far and what should be required. The document is scrupulous, sober and chilling.

My hon. Friend has done so, as have I, and we disagree in our view of it.</p> <p pid=".788.1/2">Saddam has strung us along over many years and it is a sentimental view that says that a tyrant who has maintained his regime on the basis of violence is likely to capitulate to non-violent means. The position taken by France is unrealistic because we know for sure that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> is adept at spinning out the whole process, and he will never create a situation in which it will be possible for Hans Blix to come to the United Nations and say, "The process has failed; it has run into the sands." It was only on that basis that France said that it would be willing to contemplate war. It is also evasive because it is not fair or proper to require the inspectors—the officials, the technicians—to take the decision between peace and war. That decision has to be taken by politicians and in the Security Council.</p></div>

I remind the House what was in the dossier published by the Government last October. It is not the dossier that was submitted for a PhD; it is the dossier based on the findings of the intelligence community. Among many other important findings, on page 27 we are advised that if Saddam were to be unchecked he would achieve nuclear capability in a period of not more than five years, and that were he to be supplied from the international black market with fissile material and other components that he would need for the programme it might be in as little time as one or two years.</p></div>

Friend will allow me, I shall continue.</p> <p pid=".789.4/2">It is said that we are not seriously at threat from global terrorism; that there is not a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda. Certainly the Spanish and Czech authorities, as was significantly reported in <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer">The Observer</a></i> at the weekend, believe that there have been operational links. The risk is too great to run, because Saddam must be tempted to recruit and equip terrorists from wherever he can find them. There may indeed be a coincidence of interests between al-Qaeda and Saddam's regime, notwithstanding the fact that they start from profoundly different ideological positions.</p> <p pid=".789.4/3">My right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> noted to the House some time ago that Saddam was operating what he described as a permissive regime in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> in relation to al-Qaeda. Whatever the case may be about that, it will be compellingly tempting for him to equip home-grown terrorists—terrorists whom he can recruit. Saddam harboured <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Nidal">Abu Nidal</a> and offered rewards to suicide bombers in the middle east. He is a sponsor of terrorism and will see the opportunity that is available to him.</p> <p pid=".789.4/4">Objections to the Government's policy include assertions that in the past appalling mistakes were made—that the UK played some part in arming Saddam, that we failed to dispose of him in 1991, and that during the 1990s he was allowed to continue to build weapons of mass destruction. We may note that those errors were made, but they provide no justification for making further errors.</p> <p pid=".789.4/5">People cast doubt on the motives and character of those who urge that decisive action be taken now by asking who is on whose payroll, what old scores are being settled and what vanities are in play. I remind the House that the freedom of Europe has depended on the generosity of American <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. It is arguable that if it were not for the Americans coming to our rescue, we would have fallen under Nazi or Stalinist rule. We should pay tribute to and be grateful for the courage of American military personnel then and now.</p></div>

Equally, they say, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> and the EU are damagingly split as a consequence of these events. However, it is arguable that the UN has not been the failure in every respect that some maintain it has been. In recent weeks and months, it has been the cockpit of international diplomacy, and, although it has failed to generate the international consensus that we all wanted so much, its existence provides the legal basis for the action that we need.

Friend the opportunity to do so.</p> <p pid=".790.4/3">There is a powerful moral case against war—there probably always is—but that was not the case put by the Liberal Democrats today. A more powerful case was put by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - &#39;the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)&#39;">Mr. Cook</a>, in what I thought was a powerful and impressive speech made in the House last night. It was an impressive resignation, for those of us who are students of resignations. On that subject, I am sorry to see that the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for International Development is not here—I have never seen a more spectacular failure to resign than hers over the past 24 hours. Last week, after the right hon. Lady said that the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was reckless, it was whispered in the corridors that he would take his revenge in due course. I believe that by persuading her to stay in the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> even for this last 24 hours—<i>[Laughter.]</i>—he has now taken his revenge. Even setting aside any issue of honour and consistency, we should at this time have a Cabinet whose members are absolutely, 100 per cent. agreed on the course of action, especially all the Ministers involved in the course of action, which must surely involve the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_International_Development">Department for International Development</a>. We look forward to the Prime Minister continuing to take his revenge over the next few days.</p> <p pid=".790.4/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> said that analogies with the 30s can be taken too far, and of course they can, yet in some of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to the Government's stance there is a hint of appeasement. Last night, one hon. Member—I think it was a Liberal Democrat—said that we should not take this action because of the danger of terrorist or other retaliatory action against this country. There is a similarity to the phoney war in 1940, when the commanders in charge of the great guns of the Maginot line—we all know who was in charge—refused to fire those guns in case the Germans fired back. But of course the Germans were always going to fire back, and terrorist organisations that have the capability to hit this country will try in any event to hit this country. Our job is to deter them from doing so and remove their means of doing so.</p> <p pid=".790.4/5">The Prime Minister and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a> stood on the right ground when advancing their policy today. Although there are moral arguments on either side, there are powerful moral arguments on the side of military action, as <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a> has so graphically demonstrated in recent days—perhaps she will have the chance to do so again in this debate, if she catches your eye, Madam <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>. Furthermore, although there are legal arguments on either side, we are not morally obliged to take action—if we were, we would have to take action against many other countries—nor legally obliged to do so, nor legally prevented from doing so. We should take action because it is in <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a>. The Prime Minister was right to make that argument.</p> <p pid=".790.4/6">Our national interest is wide ranging, given that ours is the fourth largest economy in the world, our trade extends across the world and our citizens may be found throughout the world. However, it is also part of our national interest to act in concert with the United States of America in matters of world peace and stability, and that is what the Government are seeking to do. Every serious attempt to advance peace in the middle east has been advanced under the auspices of the United States of America. Every successful attempt to clean up the Balkans has been undertaken only with the support of the United States of America. Those who will not venture out when a criminal is coming down the street should not complain when someone acts as the policeman. The reason why the USA takes on so many responsibilities in the world is that others shirk those responsibilities, as they have done in the Security Council in the past few weeks.</p></div>

That shows that it is possible to have a firm alliance with the United States while differing with it from time to time. That is exactly the policy of the Government. Of course, there will be differences from time to time, but when major issues of the stability of the world and the future conduct of world diplomacy are at issue, it will generally be in the interests of the United Kingdom to act in concert with the United States of America.</p> <p pid=".792.1/2">We should remember that whenever we really need help, we turn to the United States of America, and Europe turns to the United States. Without America, France would have lived under dictatorship for decades. Without America, the Germans would not have rescued themselves from a racist ideology. Without America, Europe would have exchanged Nazi tyranny for communist tyranny in the 1940s. We turned to America, and our alliance with the United States is a fundamental attribute of the foreign policy of this nation when it is correctly conducted.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".793.0/1">Relieved of my responsibilities of a while ago, I have been lucky enough to travel a great deal in the past year. I have travelled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, and I have spoken to many people. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that they do not care what happens to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. They have no time for Saddam Hussein. They care passionately about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_and_Israel">Palestine and Israel</a>, which is why it is so important that the so-called road map is put forward. They will not shed a single tear for Saddam Hussein, because they know many of the things that have been done to the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> under the rule of Saddam Hussein. So if the hon. Gentleman believes that it is a recruiting sergeant for terrorism to rid the world of that despotic dictatorship, he is making a serious mistake. We would be setting a new standard of deterrence—a new type of deterrence, which is necessary in a changed world.</p> <p pid=".793.0/2">We all grew up in the cold war. We are familiar with the cold war and the balance of terror, when it was always necessary to be ready for action, but always necessary to take minimal action so as not to disturb the balance of power in the world. But now the world has changed. Now there is no balance of power and the dangers to world peace are not from all-out nuclear confrontation between superpowers, but from the development of new weapons by rogue states and terrorist organisations.</p> <p pid=".793.0/3">Deterrence therefore takes on a new character. It is not a matter of being ready for action. It is occasionally and it will occasionally be necessary to take action to make sure that those who aspire to be rogue states or sponsors of terrorism know what happens and know how the western alliance responds to such a threat. That is why it is so important in this case to take action and to set the standard for the future. Those who say that action is not necessary now must remember that we have passed so many deadlines, so many ultimatums, that not to take action now is to reduce the credibility of any action being taken. The time has come for a decision. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has put before the House the right decision. He deserves the support of hon. Members in all parts of the House.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".793.1/1">I regret that my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - &#39;the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)&#39;">Mr. Cook</a> has resigned.

Although I understand the reasons, I disagree with them. We shall miss him in government.</p> <p pid=".793.1/2">While I am on the subject of resignations, I regret the fact that my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=851" title="Our page on John Denham - &#39;the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)&#39;">Mr. Denham</a> has also decided to resign, but I am glad that my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for International Development will be staying on.</p> <p pid=".793.1/3">The present situation reminds me of the time after Kuwait was invaded in August 1990. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> gave the regime four months to leave Kuwait. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> refused to do so. There are those present today who opposed the liberation of Kuwait, as they had every right to do, and who oppose the motion today. That does not include all the critics, by any means. Quite a number took a different line, if they were in the House, but some, including the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=88" title="The title Father of the House is given to the MP with the longest unbroken..." class="glossary">Father of the House</a>, argued strongly that we should not take military action to liberate Kuwait. What would have been the position had we not done so? Saddam Hussein would have been strengthened and would have realised that he could commit aggression with no response whatever.</p> <p pid=".793.1/4">Some of today's critics were no less opposed to action that was taken over Kosovo and Afghanistan. They argued—as I said, they had every right to do so—that we should not take such action. When we are accused of being anti-Muslim, when that vile accusation is directed at us, I would ask the House: why did we go into Kosovo? Was it to help the Christians, the Jews, the Sikhs, or the Hindus? The only reason that we intervened in Kosovo was to help the ethnic Albanians, who happen, as we all know, to be Muslims. That was the only reason and the only justification.</p> <p pid=".793.1/5">The way to demonstrate again our commitment in respect of the position of Muslims is for the international community, and not least the United States, to bring about a settlement in the middle east. I make no apology for the fact that I have supported the state of Israel from the very beginning, and for all the obvious reasons—what happened to Jews, not only in the holocaust but over 2,000 years—but I support an Israel within the 1967 borders. If the Jews are justified in having a state for all the reasons that I have just explained, the Palestinians are also justified in having a state of their own—not a sort of statelet, but a sovereign state, no less sovereign than Israel itself. I hope that my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> will make sure that the United States pursues that policy in practice, and does not just say certain words at this particular time.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".794.1/1">My hon. Friend has demonstrated again that he was wrong, as he has been on virtually every military <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, from the Falklands to Afghanistan. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taliban">The Taliban</a>, who gave room to the terrorists, were defeated, and in my view the action taken was right. I am sorry that my hon. Friend disagrees.</p> <p pid=".794.1/2">As I said in an intervention on my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, the Security Council has been at fault. It should have been far tougher over the past 12 years. We have reached the present position because some Security Council members took the view that after Kuwait there should be a less tough response to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, and he has played around. Such a tyrant has exploited every disunity, as he is doing now, on the eve of military action, for his own advantage. It is unfortunate that no tougher action was taken.</p> <p pid=".794.1/3">In previous debates, I listened to some of my hon. Friends criticising the United States. As I want my own Government to be more radical, I am hardly likely to be a fan of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_President">United States President</a>, but when I listened to some of that criticism made by hon. Members who said not a single word of criticism about the murderous tyrant in Baghdad, I thought that there was a lack of logic somewhere along the line. Surely our criticism should first and foremost be directed at the dictator.</p> <p pid=".794.1/4">I have always taken the view that if war can be avoided, it should be avoided, because of the casualties. It is no use those of us who support the Government line kidding ourselves. Innocent people will be killed. In the next few weeks, men, women and children—people who should never be killed—will be put to death, but we know that that is the result of war and military intervention. Unlike the critics, I believe that if Saddam is destroyed, it will be a significant victory not only for the international community, but first and foremost for the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".794.1/5">We have been told that there are many dictators in this world. Unfortunately, that is so and I wish it were otherwise, but I do not understand the logic of those who say, "There are many dictators, so why pick on this one?" If, as a result of the regime's refusal to get rid of weapons of mass destruction, one of the most murderous tyrannies is destroyed, surely that is a positive gain. Surely the fact that we cannot take on every dictator or many other dictators is not a reason or justification for not seeing the end of the regime in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Of course, not a single critic has, on other occasions or today, given any indication of how Saddam Hussein could be got rid of except by military action. No one here today will argue that it is up to the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. How can it be? It is only by military action that this tyranny can be destroyed.</p> <p pid=".794.1/6">I make no apology for saying that the international community as such has on many occasions turned a blind eye to tyrannies. However, I was very pleased in 1979, for example, when Tanzania liberated Uganda from the Amin regime. Was that wrong? When <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot">Pol Pot</a> was destroyed by Vietnam, also in 1979, was that wrong? Would anyone here argue along different lines?</p> <p pid=".794.1/7">In conclusion, I want simply to say that this crisis has been brought about not by the British or American Governments, but by the murderous dictator in Baghdad. If military action is taken, as we all know it will be, I wish the British and allied troops every possible success. I do not believe that we can be neutral in judging between a murderous tyranny and the democracies that will be engaged in fighting it. I believe that right is on our side and that the overwhelming <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".795.0/1">Last night, this House heard a speech of very great distinction from <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - &#39;the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)&#39;">Mr. Cook</a>. What he said was dignified and of great quality, and the fact and manner of his resignation did honour to him and, in a small way, did credit to this beleaguered profession of politics. May I also say to <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=851" title="Our page on John Denham - &#39;the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)&#39;">Mr. Denham</a>, who I believe has resigned, that his decision, too, is an extremely honourable one?</p> <p pid=".795.0/2">The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> has been extremely generous to me in previous debates and I know that I have had the opportunity to express my views in some detail on a number of occasions. I shall therefore confine myself today to making but three points. First, so far as the British forces are concerned, war is not inevitable. That may not be true of the United States forces, but it is true of the British ones, for this reason: the Government, very much to their credit, have tabled a motion before the deployment of forces into conflict. The House therefore has a choice. If we accept the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> and reject the Government motion, British forces will not be deployed into action. That is a choice for each and every one of us to make. So as far as British forces are concerned, war is not inevitable. We have to decide that.</p> <p pid=".795.0/3">Secondly, in the course of this debate and on previous occasions, a great deal of criticism has been made of the Governments of France and Germany, and of Russia and China to a lesser degree. Of course it is true that when nations vote on policy, they bring into account their own national interests—I have no doubt that national interests were involved—but it should have surprised nobody that we did not secure a consensus in the Security Council. If we are honest with ourselves, we do not have a consensus in the House or in this country. In all probability, there is not support for war. Why? Because the case for war is not overwhelming.</p> <p pid=".795.0/4">I do not speak of the legalities. I have read what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> said about that matter and I do not feel competent to express a view as to whether he is right or wrong, but I am competent to say this: many distinguished lawyers—as distinguished as the Attorney-General—will take a contrary view. In any event, if I am honest, I do not think that the legalities go to the root of the matter. The real question is whether it is right—right expressed in moral terms. Here I have to say that I think that the answer is no, because I do not think that any of the usual characteristics of a just war have been satisfied. If we were dealing with a situation in which <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had attacked another country or had mustered troops on the frontiers of another country, or if there were compelling evidence that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was delivering to terrorists weapons of mass destruction with which they could attack another country, I would vote for war, but none of those circumstances exists.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".797.0/1">I was talking about the international risk that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> poses and saying that the normal tests for war have not been satisfied in this case.</p> <p pid=".797.0/2">That brings me to my last point. I accept that there is a terrible dilemma. Incidentally, it has not come about as the result of policy decisions in the past two or three weeks, but stems from the policy decision made in the latter part of last year, when the United States and United Kingdom Governments decided further to disarm <span class="hi">Iraq</span> using force if necessary. I regard that as a critical mistake, because the policies of containment and deterrence had worked from 1991 to <span class="hi">2002</span> and would have continued to do so. That was the critical mistake.</p> <p pid=".797.0/3">Now we stand in the dilemma. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has identified it and so has my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=869" title="Our page on Iain Duncan Smith - &#39;the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)&#39;">Mr. Duncan Smith</a>: if we go to war, we affront the principles of morality to which I referred and the principles of legality, which I think are in doubt; if we do not go to war, it is true that the authority of the United Nations will have been defied and the credibility of the United States and, to a lesser extent, ourselves will be at risk.</p> <p pid=".797.0/4">So what is the way forward? How do hon. Members and reasonably minded people decide that dilemma? I can only offer my explanation. The right hon. Member for Livingston spoke yesterday of the consequences. If we go to war, the probability is that thousands and maybe tens of thousands of people will be killed or injured on all sides. That seems to me the principal question with which we should concern ourselves. I cannot find a sufficient moral case for condemning thousands or tens and thousands of people to death and injury. For that reason, because I think that war lacks a moral basis, I shall vote for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> and against the Government's motion.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".797.1/1">With regret, I resigned from the Government this morning. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve the Government and the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> since 1997. Although some have at times questioned the Government's direction, I say with all honesty that not a day has passed when I have felt that I could not make some difference on the very issues that brought me into the Labour party 27 years ago. I shall certainly miss being part of the Government.</p> <p pid=".797.1/2">The events of 9/11 must have brought home to us all the fact that we have created a world of great danger and great insecurity. That action must be taken, that we must tackle the sources and causes of insecurity, is not in doubt. But it is not simply a question of whether we take action; how we take action is also important. The reason for that is simple. If we act in the wrong way, we will create more of the problems that we aim to tackle. For every cause of insecurity with which we try to deal, we shall create a new one.</p> <p pid=".797.1/3">I am not a pacifist. I am not against armed <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. In 1992, I was one of the Labour <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> who called for much earlier intervention in Bosnia. I shall never forget the surprised and bemused expression on John Smith's face when some 20 newly elected Labour Members of Parliament went to see him to demand Labour support for a foreign war. I believe that we should have supported it, and that, had we done so, Balkan history might be different. I supported our action in Kosovo, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone">Sierra Leone</a> and Afghanistan.</p> <p pid=".797.1/4">After 9/11, however, it should have been clear that the scale and nature of the threats to global security required the world community to come together on an unprecedented scale, not only to defeat terrorism, but to tackle the conflicts that give rise to it and other threats. For a time, not least thanks to our Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, such coming together seemed possible. Today, the prospect is severely damaged, if not in disarray. That has happened not simply or primarily because of one country across the channel, unprincipled and disastrously unilateral in its way though France has been. It has happened because those who wish to take action now, and in the way in which we are considering, have failed to persuade others and thus create international consensus on the need to do so.</p> <p pid=".797.1/5">The question for me has never been one of narrow legality. I was in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> long enough to know that lawyers are the last thing one needs when things are difficult. It is a question not of one or two votes either way in the Security Council, but of whether we can put our hands on our hearts and say that the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of those who should support us do so. I do not believe that they do.</p> <p pid=".797.1/6">I do not blame the Prime Minister for that. No one could have worked harder to forge consensus. His achievements are real, not least in persuading the US Administration to take the United Nations route. However, our Prime Minister has been ill served by those whom he sought to influence. The US Administration appear at times to delight in stressing their disdain for international opinion and in asserting their right to determine not only the target but the means and the timetable, their gratuitous actions apparently designed to make a common voice impossible, not least here in Europe. That has made the international coming together that we need impossible to achieve.</p> <p pid=".797.1/7">In future, people will ask how one nation could have thrown away the world's sympathy in such a way. Does anyone doubt that a nation of such power, influence and, in many ways, such genuine authority could have built the support that we needed if it believed that necessary? I am not indulging in anti-Americanism, but simply recognising that unilateralism on such a scale, no matter how legitimate the target, brings danger.</p> <p pid=".797.1/8">The action against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is, I believe, pre-emptive, and therefore demands even greater international support and consensus than other sorts of intervention. We do not have it. Such isolation entails a genuine cost and danger. It undermines the legitimacy that we must maintain to tackle the many threats to global security. It fuels the movements that are antipathetic to our values and way of life, and the view, which is probably the reality, that in an interdependent world, one nation reserves the right to determine which of the world's problems should be tackled, when, where and in what way.</p></div>

If I believed that that would work, I could swallow my qualms and sign up for that with the right hon. Gentleman. But I do not. I believe that the reaction to such a method of working will be as dangerous as the problems that we are trying to solve. It will turn many parts of the world against us, undermine friendly Governments, fuel terrorism and those who will join it in the future, and make it more difficult to sustain international action against common problems.</p> <p pid=".799.1/3">If the motion were on the honesty, integrity, commitment and sheer courage of our <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, I would not hesitate to support it.

I cannot support it.</p> <p pid=".799.1/4">My final point is a difficult one. I, too, have constituents who are in our armed forces in the Gulf, and their families at home. The failures of Governments and of the international community are not their failings. Although I clearly do not believe that we should commit our troops to action now, they should not feel that they are on the wrong side, that the enemy they face is not evil or that the world would not be a better place without <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>.</p> <p pid=".799.1/5">If the vote of the House commits our troops to fight, we must stand with them.

I have no disagreement with any part of the lengthy but substantive motion that they have tabled. I am not in favour of war. In fact, I am positively opposed to it. War is brutal, cruel and indiscriminate. Innocent people will undoubtedly die in any conflict that takes place, but there are occasions on which war is inevitable if the civilised world is to defend its civilisation against a despotic tyrant such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>.</p> <p pid=".799.2/5">Like a number of other hon. Members, I have served in Her Majesty's forces—not as a regular officer but as a national service officer—and I understand the way in which our armed services live, and their loyalty and team spirit. Like everyone else who has spoken, I express the hope that this will be a short war and that the minimum casualties will be incurred, not only in our armed services but among civilians as well. Members of my own family have served in wars, in north Africa and Burma, at Dunkirk, in Normandy and, more recently, in the Korean war. So, to those who say that people like me who agree with the Government do not know what we are doing, I would say that we do know. Likewise, I honour and respect the position that has been expressed by the right hon.

We want to ensure that the men and women among the troops of Her Majesty's forces have the best possible equipment available. I know, from my own contact with members of the armed services who are currently in Kuwait, that they are ready to go and that they believe that they have the equipment and the support to enable them to do an excellent job.</p> <p pid=".800.1/2">The history that was so accurately sketched by the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> is right. We have had 17 resolutions since April 1991. The first, resolution 687, required <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to</p> <p class="indent" pid=".800.1/3">"make a declaration within 15 days of the location and amounts" of its weapons of mass destruction.

I congratulate the Government, the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> and the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence on what they are doing, not only in <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a> but in the international interest.</p> <p pid=".800.1/5">I would like to raise one issue that might be controversial. I am saddened by what I perceive to be the anti-American views that are being expressed. As someone who will shortly reach his 65th birthday, I believe that the world as a whole owes an immense debt to the United States for what it has done over more than 50 years for peace and stability in the world, and for the humanitarian aid that it has advanced. It has been wrong on occasions, but, my goodness, haven't we all? Overall, I believe that the benefit that the United States and its successive Administrations have brought to the world have been immense, and they should be very proud of that.</p> <p pid=".800.1/6">I am delighted that the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister have highlighted the importance of achieving peace in the middle east, if at all possible. The road map is absolutely right. It is important that the state of Israel, within its 1967 boundaries, should be guaranteed by the international community, but it is also essential that the Palestinian people, who have suffered so greatly, should be given a meaningful, consolidated state. That would lead to stability in the middle east. If we remove Saddam Hussein in the next few days, as I hope will be the case, the chance of bringing peace to the region will be that much greater.</p> <p pid=".800.1/7">I have sent a petition to the Prime Minister carrying about 700 signatures from my Macclesfield constituents expressing their concern and their <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to the war. I say to them, "On this issue, put your trust in the Prime Minister. I fervently believe, as your <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a>, that he is right." We will get it right; we will bring peace to the middle east, and we will restore the credibility of the United Nations.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".801.0/1">This is the moment that we have all been dreading—the moment at which we have, individually and collectively, to decide on which side of the line in the sand we choose to stand. War is hell, as an American civil war general once said, but, for the Iraqis, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurds">Iraqi Kurds</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_Arabs">Marsh Arabs</a>, the Kuwaitis or the Iranians who have been the victims of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, the so-called peace can be hellish, too. Any agonies of conscience that I had have been resolved, and I shall vote with the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the official <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> this evening on many grounds. That is not to say that I do not have uncertainties and difficulties with the problems facing our armed forces, or with the consequences of our action. Of course I do. I shall certainly not argue that no mistakes have been made by the Americans or the British—little mistakes or bigger mistakes. Perhaps the biggest mistake was to misjudge France, Russia and, possibly, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Parliament">Turkish Parliament</a>. The biggest misjudgment of all, however, was surely Saddam's, when he desperately hoped that the cavalry—or should I say the French cuirassiers, the German uhlans, hussars, lancers and dragoons, and the Russian imperial Cossacks—would ride to his assistance. It remains to be seen whether 'Smith's Fencibles'—or indefensibles—will succeed where they have failed, later this evening.</p> <p pid=".801.0/2">I believe that the strategy of the United States and the United Kingdom of combining military and diplomatic pressure could have worked, had it been backed up by the support of the United Nations. The combination would surely have been irresistible for Saddam Hussein, and he and his sons would have jumped on their camels and ridden off into the great unknown—probably somewhere in central Asia or even an expensive flat on the Champs Elysées. That never happened, however. It could have happened, and those who made it not happen must surely have a great deal on their conscience.</p> <p pid=".801.0/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>—incidentally, I am not standing for election as chair of the Walsall chapter of his fan club—has gone down the diplomatic route for a long time, and his speech last night showed that he is still prepared to do that, by giving Saddam Hussein one final chance. I support the Government because the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> said yesterday that there was a legal basis for the war. To those who have argued that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a> needed more time I say this: the inspectors' work restarted in the spring of last year; the inspections recommenced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-27">27 November</phrase>, and Dr. Blix told the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Committee">Defence Committee</a> three weeks ago—I refer to the notes that I and the Committee Clerk took at the meeting—that:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".801.0/4">"The provisions of resolution 1284 could be fulfilled within a year if <span class="hi">Iraq</span> chose to co-operate".</p> <p pid=".801.0/5">A year! I do not think that that time is available. He went on to say</p> <p class="indent" pid=".801.0/6">"Without co-operation, the inspectors' task is endless."</p> <p pid=".801.0/7">Surely what the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said today was that the task of the inspectors and also the waiting period would be endless, and that that time had run out.</p> <p pid=".801.0/8">I doubt that the United States and the United Kingdom would wish their troops to endure the wait for any longer than necessary for the purpose of expecting Saddam Hussein to co-operate. He will duck and dive, and use anything to thwart the United Nations. Any enthusiasm that remained after 12 months of waiting would surely be dissipated.</p> <p pid=".801.0/9">We keep being told that the United States and the United Kingdom stand alone. In a letter in today's <i>Guardian</i>, a lady wrote that perhaps only Spain and Portugal remained holiday venues for the Blairs. It should be said that Australia, the Netherlands, Denmark and almost all of eastern and central Europe support the Prime Minister, and provide wonderful holiday destinations. We could add <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a>, Japan, most of the Gulf—<i>[Interruption.]</i></p></div>

I am sure it was the right decision to remove the Taliban regime, and to try and restore some order to that troubled country.</p></div>

Sadly, that has not happened. During that period my constituents, whose concerns I share, took the critical view that both the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_President">American President</a> were not making a proper case for war. They were not helped by the unfortunate "dodgy dossier", which I think caused huge harm to the credibility of the Government's case. They were not helped by the suggestions of the American Administration, and at times our own Ministers, that for some time there have been direct and close links between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> regime and al-Qaeda terrorists. That was clearly not true. There is never any point in exaggerating one's case, because one will not be believed.</p> <p pid=".804.1/6">I listened carefully to what I thought was one of the Prime Minister's outstanding speeches. I was convinced and satisfied that the case had now been made. I agree with my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1331" title="Our page on Nicholas Winterton - &#39;the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)&#39;">Sir Nicholas Winterton</a>, who expressed the hope that the full text of the speech would be given the widest circulation among the British public. I am confident that if it is, there will be a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> in favour of military action later this week.</p> <p pid=".804.1/7">It was also absolutely right for us and our American allies to send huge numbers of troops to the Gulf. I believe that only by that means—along with resolution 1441 and the presence of the weapons inspectors—could pressure be put on Saddam Hussein. At that point, however—here I return to the intervention from my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1034" title="Our page on Andrew Lansley - &#39;the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)&#39;">Mr. Lansley</a>—we were sadly let down by our French colleagues: our French allies. I believe that their behaviour has been nothing short of disgraceful.</p> <p pid=".804.1/8">I am satisfied that many hon.

I shall take no lessons from a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_President">French President</a> who breaks sanctions and invites the murderous Mugabe to Paris. I shall take no lessons from a French President and his defence <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> who threatened EU applicant states for merely supporting us and the Americans, and for signing a letter of support.</p> <p pid=".805.1/2">The behaviour of the French has been disgraceful. It ill befits a close ally and friend. I feel sorry for the French people today. I regret that the President was re-elected last year. I believe that he has done great harm to the international community.</p> <p pid=".805.1/3">In conclusion, every hon. Member faces a simple choice tonight. We must decide which course of action is more likely to bring peace and stability to the world and, in the short, medium and long term, ensure that fewer innocent lives, whether civilian or military, are lost.</p> <p pid=".805.1/4">I passionately believe that the whole international community would suffer if we and our American allies withdrew our troops from the Iraqi border without <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> having complied with the UN resolutions that he has flouted. Every terrorist and tin-pot dictator around the world would be given a green light. The harm and damage that that would do, to us and to future generations, is incalculable. That is why I have reached the conclusion that the right thing to do tonight is to oppose the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> and support the Government motion.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".805.2/1">It is a privilege to speak in a debate that in some ways seems to have started last night, when my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - &#39;the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)&#39;">Mr. Cook</a> made his personal statement. I should like to pay a brief but deeply felt tribute to my right hon. Friend. I had the opportunity to work with him, in <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> when I was deputy in his team, and in government. He can look back on hugely significant achievements in all the roles that he has fulfilled in his time in the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>.</p> <p pid=".805.2/2">It is a privilege to speak in the debate, but somewhat daunting. I find myself in the uncomfortable position of finding it very difficult to decide how to vote at the end of the debate. The arguments on each side are compelling. My right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> made a very powerful speech. I acknowledge and welcome that he said that hon. Members faced a test not of loyalty, but of whether they were convinced by the arguments, and by the rightness of what he proposes. That is a comfort to those of us who are fiercely proud of our Government, and of all their many achievements to date.</p> <p pid=".805.2/3">When this matter was last debated, I voted with the Government. I felt that they were very vigorously pursuing the UN route. It the culmination of that process that troubles me this evening.</p> <p pid=".805.2/4">I supported the Government very strongly in relation to Afghanistan and Kosovo. I certainly believe that military action can be justified in certain circumstances, but the motion before the House troubles me in a number of ways. War is a last resort, to be begun only if it is absolutely essential. Despite my keen desire to see <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> disarmed—and to see the end of him, if at all possible—I have to ask whether war is essential this week. Is it essential now?</p> <p pid=".805.2/5">Saddam Hussein has behaved despicably, it is true. As many speakers have noted, he has delayed disarmament over a period of 12 years. However, some progress has been made in the past 12 weeks, perhaps more than in the past 12 years. For that reason, I should like the inspection process to given an opportunity to produce results.</p> <p pid=".805.2/6">My right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said, rightly, that dealing with Saddam Hussein was like drawing teeth. However, I think that some teeth are being drawn. For that reason, too, I believe that the inspection process should have some time in which to work—even if that time is of limited duration.</p> <p pid=".805.2/7">Two countries apart from our own have figured in the debate—the US and France. I want to draw a clear distinction between those countries and their peoples, for whom many will feel a huge affinity. In my case, I have ties of both family and friendship, but many people at present feel totally at odds politically with those countries' Administrations.</p> <p pid=".805.2/8">I believe that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France">President of France</a> behaved outrageously in throwing a mega-spanner into the UN works. That follows his equally outrageous statements on EU enlargement. However, I also believe that the American policy has many faults. At times, the Americans' diplomacy has been atrocious, especially in the summer of last year. Then, they were brought back to the UN route only by the efforts of our own Government.</p> <p pid=".805.2/9">My right hon. Friend the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said that if we did not support the US now, they would be tempted in future to go down the unilateral route. That worries me, as I do not want to feel intimidated into supporting action now on that basis.</p> <p pid=".805.2/10">I am worried by some elements of the Government's case. The links between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and al-Qaeda seem tenuous in the extreme. Although the proliferation issue is serious and important, the risk of proliferation is very often to be found more in states where there is very little control. That applies especially to states that used to belong to the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>. I consider them a real risk in terms of proliferation at present.</p> <p pid=".805.2/11">In conclusion, I worry about the timing of this military action, given that weapons inspectors could still pursue their work and that alliance building could still occur. That is why, so far, I remain unconvinced. 3.28 pm</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".807.0/1">I wished to pick up a point made by both the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty&#39;s Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> about the comparison between the situation we are now in and 1938 that seems to me utterly inappropriate. In the confrontation between the west, and other democracies, and <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, the similarity with 1938 has already happened. It happened when <span class="hi">Iraq</span> invaded Kuwait, when the House and my party supported military action to confront <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> and secure Kuwait's liberation. For the past 12 years, there has been an inconsistent policy towards <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, while that country got weaker and weaker and its capacity to inflict damage in the area reduced.</p> <p pid=".807.0/2">The sad situation that we have reached today is that the United Nations' own agents tell us that they believe that they are making progress towards neutralising the situation. It would be possible to secure international agreement either to accept that we can secure peaceful disarmament through the operation of the weapons inspectors or to give support for military action if the weapons inspectors conclude—after they have been given the time for which they have asked—that they cannot complete the job. Most of us now believe that we are facing a premature and pre-emptive decision to embark on military action before the process has been concluded.</p> <p pid=".807.0/3">Many of us are also concerned about the possible consequences. We all hope that military action will be swift and clean, with minimal casualties. However, even if not a single life is lost, at the end of that venture—if it is undertaken in the way that is proposed this week—the international community will be fractured in a way that has not been witnessed since the end of the second world war. That is because the approach to dealing with the problem has been totally incoherent, partly because the US Administration decided at the outset what they would do and demonstrated no real commitment to persuading the international community of the merits of their case.</p> <p pid=".807.0/4">We have been confused about whether the US objective is regime change, the defeat of international terrorism or the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. Regardless of the legal advice—and I am not competent to comment on it—we can all recognise that the only legitimate reason for the United Nations to back action in the case of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> would be to deal with weapons of mass destruction. That position should have been sustained throughout. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_President">The President</a>'s speech about the axis of evil and rogue states has raised many concerns about what will happen after <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, especially as the US attitude to the UN has been inconsistent.</p> <p pid=".807.0/5">At first, the US saw no real role for the UN, or any need for resolution 1441. Thanks to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a>, resolution 1441 was achieved, with the clear understanding that a further resolution would be required. Then we were told that a second resolution was not needed, because resolution 1441 stood on its own. That leaves us with the United Kingdom divided, Europe divided, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> divided and the UN divided. Many of us share a deep anxiety—and it grieves me to say so—that those divisions may be exactly the outcome that the Bush Administration wanted.</p> <p pid=".807.0/6">The US Administration appear to be motivated by a fundamentalist conviction about the rightness of their cause, the absoluteness of their power and their ability to confront the world and say, "We will decide who the good guys are, who the bad guys are and what course of action will be taken. Your job is to back us or make yourself our enemies."</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".808.1/1">Everybody knows that the French have had their own view on transatlanticism for many years, and there is nothing new or unexpected about the position that they have adopted. Those of us with friends and relations in the US will understand the clear anxiety among the US population that they are vulnerable to attack in a way that they have never felt before and they look to their Government to demonstrate strong action to defend them against that attack. The problem is that that anxiety has encouraged a form of US nationalism that is determined to demonstrate that they can hit back hard after the shock of the terrorist attack on mainland America. Many of us were persuaded that that was legitimate in the case of Afghanistan, because the Taliban Administration was clearly harbouring the perpetrators of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, and we backed that action. There is not the same connection in the case of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. In those circumstances, we are entitled to argue that the case for military action has not been made.</p> <p pid=".808.1/2">Even if this war is quick, effective and decisive, and even if, as <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=908" title="Our page on Bruce George - &#39;the right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)&#39;">Mr. George</a> claimed, opinion polls swing behind the Government because of a short, sharp, successful action—although such polls are not a concern of mine—the problems that I have described will still be there for a considerable time. How do we rebuild the ability of the international community to work together when the American Administration have demonstrated an unwillingness to use international institutions constructively?</p> <p pid=".808.1/3">With a number of colleagues from this House, I was in Athens yesterday at a meeting of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_Union">Western European Union</a>. The meeting was organised by the Greek presidency of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEU">WEU</a> to discuss common mechanisms for Europe and America to defeat terrorism. However, everybody questioned how we could work together without a consistent engagement of trust and purpose with the American Administration, the tactics of which were based on economic bullying and political threats—such as the indication that, if France pursues its present line, it will face significant economic boycotts.</p> <p pid=".808.1/4">We have to consider how to rebuild the effectiveness of transatlantic co-operation in the aftermath of this war. We have to make clear our absolute determination to work together to defeat international terrorism, which threatens all of us. We need common purpose and we need to share intelligence. However, in return for a guarantee of international support, which we want to give, we are entitled to ask the Americans to acknowledge their responsibility to offer genuine leadership to the world and to show respect towards other democratic countries that do not always share the objectives of the United States and do not see the world as being defined entirely in terms of the economic interests of the United States. I respect the leadership role that the United States can and must give the world. However, if the United States is going to provide leadership for the world, the United States needs to provide a world leader.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".809.0/1">I want to say how much I appreciated the opening comments of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. I welcome his respect for the views of all those who have strong feelings on this matter. When Parliament was recalled last September, I tabled an early-day motion making my position clear. I have not moved from that position one jot. This is a challenging time for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> and we have a heavy task in front of us in this debate. However, I have never been clearer in my mind about my position. Many people in the country feel that the inspectors have not been given time to complete their task in dealing with weapons of mass destruction in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. I say to my right hon. Friends that, at this time, I fundamentally disagree with the military action that they intend to take.</p> <p pid=".809.0/2">Much has been made of the road map for Palestine. In the aftermath of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, many people rushed to make statements on how the Palestinian issue and the middle east peace process were central to resolving the long-term problems at the heart of the cause of the tragedy that occurred, and the atrocities that were committed, that day. However, people are right to stop and take stock of what is being proposed with the road map. For me, it may not be too little, but it is certainly too late. The US may be sincere in what it says about the road map but, coming at this late stage, it smacks too much of political expediency. I have no doubt that pressure from this House has led to the road map at this late stage.</p> <p pid=".809.0/3">I understand something about road maps from my previous profession: the obvious route is not always the best way to get to one's destination. I do not say that to trivialise the matter. I sincerely believe that this House still has a significant role to play in ensuring that we reach the destination that we all want in terms of the middle east peace process, but it is not just a question of the views of this House, and it never has been. It is about how people in the middle east view the west and how we pursue our foreign policies and about learning the lessons of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>. It is about our not continuing to be, through the way in which we pursue our foreign policies, recruiting agents for Osama bin Laden and other terrorist organisations. I say to <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=930" title="Our page on William Hague - &#39;the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)&#39;">Mr. Hague</a> that it is not an attack on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> that will be the recruiting agent, but the double standards that have been applied in relation to the rush to deal with Saddam Hussein at this stage and the approach taken to resolution 242, which has sat on the table for 35 years and has not been dealt with.</p> <p pid=".809.0/4">After <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, many people made the case for dealing with the middle east peace process to secure the peace for the long term. We understand the importance of ending the occupation of Palestinian territories, ending the plight of Palestinian people in their own land and stopping settlements that are in direct breach of United Nations resolutions on Palestinian territory. If we are to develop a new world order, we have to address those issues in tandem with the issue of weapons of mass destruction.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".810.1/1">Not at this stage.</p> <p pid=".810.1/2">Much has been made of the use of the veto at the UN, but we are not all innocent in that respect. In the past 30 years, the United States has vetoed 34 resolutions concerning Israel. The veto has been used 250 times, in more than 40 per cent. of cases in relation to issues involving the middle east. Only this week, we have seen yet another attack in Gaza, where 10 people were killed, including a four-year-old child. Even in the days after <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, people were attacked and killed by Israeli forces in Jenin and Jericho. I have to ask whether that is the action of a country that recognises the weight of the issues involved in the tragedy that occurred on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> or its role in securing long-term peace. We need to find a way forward. How do we get those people to follow the route map set out by the United States and our Government? How do we convince Arab people of our sincerity? What guarantee is there that after this conflict is over the road map will not be lost?</p> <p pid=".810.1/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_USA">The USA</a> provides $2.1 billion of aid every year to Israel. Only last October, there was a request for another $10 billion of aid because the intifada has hit its economy and almost cut it in half. Just by threatening to cross a nought off the end of that aid, we could bring Israel seriously to the negotiating table and sort out the problem once and for all. We need more time and we need to deal with the issues in parallel. If we are to convince the wider world community of our sincerity, why not give the inspectors more time to deal with <span class="hi">Iraq</span> in tandem with sealing, progressing and following the route map that has been set out in terms of Israel?</p> <p pid=".810.1/4">The stakes involved are too high for failure. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> is right to challenge the USA. For too long, the USA has been able to say to the United Nations, "Jump", and the United Nations has said, "How high?" The UN is absolutely right in this new world order to question whether it should jump in terms of the timing of any action that should be taken. I do not support what France has done during the past week—its actions have hastened the deadline for war—nor do I support its attempt to create a European axis against the United States in a new world order.</p> <p pid=".810.1/5">The UN is ours, faults and all. It is the route by which we should decide that in future we will negotiate away these difficult situations without the need to resort to military action. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said in his opening statement that the UN should be the focus of diplomacy and of action. I agree. If we are to win the peace for my children and for future generations of children, we have to go back to the UN and give it more time.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".810.2/1">I am very pleased to be called to speak in this debate at such an early hour. I believe that I have perhaps one small advantage over other Members of this House, which is that I have personal experience of being bombed by the Pentagon while in a capital city. I was in Belgrade, and then in Pristina, during the Kosovo campaign, when B-52s and cruise missiles were deployed in an operation conducted, after all, by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - &#39;the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)&#39;">Mr. Cook</a>, whose moving speech I listened to with great attention last night. Of course, that operation was carried out without UN endorsement. I remember writing some very angry articles while in Belgrade about the way in which that war was conducted, because I honestly hated the methods that were used. I despised the bombing from 30,000 ft, which seemed to me to be cruel and erratic. I also loathed some of the anti-Serb rhetoric, and I became, among the many unfashionable aspects of my beliefs, rather pro-Serb.</p> <p pid=".810.2/2">I saw lives ruined and families destroyed by bombing, and I saw civilians grieving for their loved ones, who had been killed by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>. We all saw the results of the Pentagon's tragic mistakes: the slaughter of people in a convoy of tractors, the train that was blown up on the bridge, and the killing of the make-up girls who worked for Serbian television. I in no way retract all my criticisms of those methods, but as I look back now on that reporting, I must admit that my anger obscured a separate truth: the aim was a good one, and it was a good idea to force Milosevic to stop his persecution of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovar_Albanians">Kosovar Albanians</a>, and to do what we could to force him from office. One would have to be rather perverse not to agree that the world is better for his going; indeed, Serbia is better and the whole of the former Yugoslavia is better. There are no more hideous pogroms whipped up by ruthless politicians, setting one ethnic group against another. There is no more torching of houses, no more rape camps, and all the rest of it.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".811.3/1">I listen to the hon. Gentleman's point with great interest, but to be frank, I wonder why his party now stands against action to help the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, given that its previous leader, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Ashdown">Paddy Ashdown</a>, was so vigilant and fierce in his demands for humanitarian action on behalf of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovar_Albanians">Kosovar Albanians</a>. I find that a very curious reflection on how times have changed for the Liberal Democrats, and I wonder whether it has anything to do with opportunism and how they see the public opinion polls moving. I do not really understand their motivation.</p> <p pid=".811.3/2">There is much that I admire about the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a>, the right hon. Member for Livingston. I noted with interest the acclaim with which he was greeted on the Government Back Benches last night, which may or may not be ominous for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. There was one striking omission from the right hon. Gentleman's speech, however. He dwelt at length on the threat that Saddam might, or might not, pose to western security—I thought that he was too optimistic about that—but he said not a word about the condition of the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. How many people has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> killed? Is it 100,000, 200,000—a million? We have all met Iraqi people who yearn for that man to be removed. I am thinking in particular of an Iraqi computer technician who said, "You guys have got to get rid of Saddam Hussein because no matter how many people Bush kills it will not be as many as Saddam kills in a year".</p> <p pid=".811.3/3">The right hon. Member for Livingston spoke of a long-standing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American">Anglo-American</a> agenda to get rid of Saddam Hussein. Like many others, the right hon. Gentleman wanted to know "why now?" and "why Saddam Hussein?". Such objections are logically frail and hardly amount to an argument for doing nothing now. If anything, they are an argument for wishing that we had done something earlier and, indeed, in other places. To people who ask, "What about Mugabe?", I reply, "Indeed, why don't we do something there?"</p> <p pid=".811.3/4">It is possible to criticise many aspects of the way in which the Government have prepared the country for the course of action that we are about to take. I shall not delay the House further with repetition of my objections to the dodgy dossier and the UN bungling. I do not know who made the diplomatic assessment of the likelihood of French accession to a second UN resolution but he obviously blundered.</p> <p pid=".811.3/5">We can dilate until the cows come home about what the situation means for the so-called common European security and defence policy, which has nothing in common, nothing to do with security and barely amounts to a policy. I shall not go further into the curious hermaphroditic policy of the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p pid=".811.3/6">We should all like a second UN resolution but that is not going to happen. Tonight, we have to decide whether to give authorisation for British forces to engage in enforcement of UN resolution 1441 and, indeed, the 17 other UN resolutions that Saddam Hussein has continually flouted. Having learned the lessons from what I saw in Serbia, I shall vote for the motion. There are several reasons but one is paramount. It will mean the enforcement of the will of the UN and the removal of Saddam Hussein will make the world a better place, but, above all, it will make the world better for the millions of Iraqis whom he oppresses.</p> <p pid=".811.3/7">I deeply respect the hesitations of people on both sides of the House, but, as they make up their minds, I urge them to think of those people in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and to decide whether, by our votes and actions tonight, we shall be prolonging their misery or bringing it to an end.</p></div>

Every time that a psychopathic killer takes over a nation state, they drive people out; they commit genocide, murder and torture of a type that is hard to imagine and, because I represent a west London <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, I see their victims in my waiting room. I have seen the victims of the Shah of Iran, the Ayatollah, Milosevic and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, but only in one case—Saddam Hussein—have I seen people tremble at the mere mention of his name.</p> <p pid=".813.0/3">The regime is gruesome in the extreme and it is dangerous. Although I can accept the moral case on either side of the argument, it has always struck me as odd that democratic, freedom-loving, tolerant politicians can get ourselves in a moral mess when we are confronted with such people and try to determine who is morally right in the argument about whether we should go to war. The only person who is morally bankrupt in that argument is Saddam Hussein. We should never have illusions about that, and it also reinforces our views about what is right and what is wrong.</p> <p pid=".813.0/4">I have also heard in the debate, unlike perhaps some of the others, ambivalence about the United States, varying from <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=930" title="Our page on William Hague - &#39;the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)&#39;">Mr. Hague</a>, who takes the view that the United States saved us in the second world war. I do not take that view—it ignores the contributions of Britain, the fact that the Russians broke the back of the German army and a whole range of other things—nor do I take the view, which comes from various quarters of the House, that somehow everything that the United States does is bad.</p> <p pid=".813.0/5">Yes, the reality is that the United States is the dominant power of the day and, yes, it is true—we ought to remember this more than anyone else—that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush">George Bush</a> looks increasingly like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> in drag. I accept that the United States is doing the great power act and throwing its weight around in the world, but that does not make it wrong on such an issue.</p> <p pid=".813.0/6">The true criticism of the international community, the United States and all hon. Members is that we have done nothing about what has been happening in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> since 1991. The real criticism of all us is that we did nothing when <span class="hi">Iraq</span> first started to breach not just the 1991 resolutions, but the ceasefire itself, which Saddam had never put into effect. That ceasefire was signed with the UN, not the United States, and he breached it time and again with genocide, torture, human rights abuses, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism—the lot—and we did nothing, because of which many people have died and the misery continues.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".814.1/1">I regard that as ineffectual. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Let me say why. The one bit that was effective was the no-fly zones. It tells us an awful lot that there is no starvation, no torture and plenty of medical supplies in either of those areas, and they use the same oil-for-food programme as that available to the rest of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Of course what failed was the sanctions regime itself. Why? Because <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> did what all psychopaths do in such situations—he used the weapons against his opponents. He starved the people who did not support him and he fed the people who did. We need only look at the television broadcasts from the time when he organised demonstrations in Baghdad against the sanctions and, lo and behold, they involved well-fed, well-dressed people—his own supporters. Those broadcasts did not show the real misery and how Saddam himself had caused it.</p> <p pid=".814.1/2">I tell hon. Members that we really do have a duty—this is where I come to the political bit—to face up to the UN's failure to deal with those people. We call them tyrants and dictators, but if they were the people beating up their wives or children in a house down the road, we would call them psychopaths and send for the police who would arrest them and put them inside. We only started doing that 50 years ago. Before then, we used to walk by with our fingers in our ears, saying "We cannot intervene; it is his own house, you know." That is what we do with the nation state, and it is why <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=967" title="Our page on Douglas Hogg - &#39;the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)&#39;">Mr. Hogg</a> is wrong about the morality. His morality is based on the concept of the nation state. I take the view that the UN ultimately needs to intervene more effectively when those psychopathic killers take over nation states. We need to be able to do that. We do not want to do it by force with an armed invasion straight away, but we have to find ways to deal with such things because every time we leave them, not only do we sentence those people to absolute misery, but we destabilise the area.</p> <p pid=".814.1/3">Many Arabs live in my <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, and I will tell hon. Members that Arabs have no less a commitment to democracy, freedom and tolerance than anyone else. They do not like Saddam Hussein. Many of them do not support the war, but they all want rid of him. The reality is that—this is the other part of the political equation—if we want a settlement in the middle east, particularly of the Palestine-Israel situation, we also have to deal with Saddam Hussein; the two are linked in that sense. If the world wants to move forward and face up to the problems of terrorism, we must also deal with states that produce weapons of mass destruction. Instead of just reading Dr. Blix's abbreviated report to the Security Council, hon. Members should go to the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> Library, get the full document, and look at the list of things that Dr. Blix says that Saddam Hussein has got, some of which I have never heard of before. Unless we find ways of dealing with that, we risk the future of this world, too.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".815.2/1">I have a great deal of experience of commending my right hon. Friends the Members for Chingford and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodford_Green">Woodford Green</a> (Mr. Duncan Smith) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Yorks">Richmond, Yorks</a> (Mr. Hague) on the speeches that they have made as Leaders of Her Majesty's <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>. I have much less experience of commending the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, but I do so today without reservation. I would use his statement as the basis for a reply to any letter that I got from a constituent, as I feel that it represented broadly my analysis of and my reaction to the events that we face today.</p> <p pid=".815.2/2">I will not reiterate the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s arguments, but I want to pick out two points. First, he said that the psychology of the United States changed, without qualification, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>. I was on the last <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a> flight out of Boston prior to the hijacking of the planes that were used in the attacks. I was back in the United States two weeks later and have been there on a number of occasions subsequently. That psychological change is real, lasting and important. I agree with the Prime Minister that the rest of us had better go through that psychological change, and that we better do so quickly. The fact that so many have not yet faced up to those circumstances—God forbid that they should be forced to face up to them on the back of another atrocity such as that experienced by the Americans—and that Europe has not yet been gripped by that psychological change lies partly at the heart of the difficulties that we face.</p> <p pid=".815.2/3">Secondly, I want to highlight the Prime Minister's comment that there is no point in willing the ends if we are not prepared to will the means. That remark was addressed to his party and to our party—it was pointless addressing it to the Liberals, as they would not understand it. It is fundamental to the whole debate. Sooner or later, we must face up to some realities. This is not a debate about how much legality is on one side, and how much morality is on the other. I am just a simple Belfast boy: to me, it is a question of whether we have the will to do what we believe and know to be right, after having prevaricated for a long time.</p> <p pid=".815.2/4">Most of us in this House are parents. When we went through parenting, the one thing that we were told repeatedly was, "Don't say no to the children unless you mean it and unless you will make it stick." That was because every time we said no and they ignored it, and we ignored their ignoring of it, we made it more difficult to put in place a discipline framework for the future. Internationally and nationally, we have been guilty of saying no, and then ignoring the ignoring of that instruction. It is now time to take action, and I support the Government's intention.</p> <p pid=".815.2/5">Having said that, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> made the point in his statement last night that the second resolution</p> <p class="indent" pid=".815.2/6">"has never been needed legally, but we have long had a preference for it politically."</p> <p pid=".815.2/7">We should not run away from the fact that our failure to secure it represents a political failure with which we must deal. When that point was put to the Foreign Secretary later, he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".815.2/8">"France and Russia informally proposed that there should be a lock in resolution 1441 requiring that before any military action or any enforcement of the system of disarmament proposed—by force—there had to be a second resolution. France and Russia dropped that proposition. They never even put it forward as a formal <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>."—[<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pop=1&amp;s=date:20030317+column:703+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 17 March 2003; Vol. 401, c. 703–708</a>.]</p> <p pid=".815.2/9">That was an extremely good answer in the field of diplomacy, but it was no answer in the field of politics. We are faced with the fact that there has been a political failure and a political breakdown. The Government must start to address that political failure quickly otherwise some of the more dire consequences that have been predicted may come back to haunt us, although I do not believe that they invariably follow from the Government's action.</p> <p pid=".815.2/10">There are two reasons why we need to reaffirm our will to act and focus on repairing the political damage. The first is that unless the damage is repaired, it will become more difficult to get new resolutions on humanitarian aid and the restructuring of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> through the United Nations. The situation might become more protracted, which is not to our advantage or to that of our troops, and it is certainly not to the advantage of the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. The second reason, which my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=999" title="Our page on Boris Johnson - &#39;the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)&#39;">Mr. Johnson</a> mentioned, is that part of the political opposition in the country to the Government's proposals exists because they have not talked about an exit strategy. The House has no idea about how we intend to get out of the situation after the war is over. I believe that the absence of any conversation about an exit strategy is fuelling concern about, and antipathy toward, the actions that the Government must take.</p> <p pid=".815.2/11">In summary, I support what the Government are doing and I shall join them in the Lobby this evening. However, I urge them to take seriously the political failure at the heart of the issue and to take steps quickly to address it for the benefit of <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a>, as well as the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".816.0/1">There is only one issue that we must consider today: whether we should go to war at this time and set what is, to me, the terrible precedent of starting a pre-emptive war on a dubious legal basis without the support of the United Nations. Nothing else should matter. The issue should transcend party politics. We know how the Front Benchers, Whips and others will argue that support for the war is a vital party loyalty test—whether that is support for the Conservative party or for the Labour party—but the issue is too serious for that. It should transcend our careers, whether we are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> or Front Benchers, because in this context we should regard ourselves as here today, gone tomorrow politicians. I do not remember the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s exact words, but he summed it up when he said something to the effect that we are talking about the future safety of the world and therefore we should be concerned about the future of our children and future generations.</p> <p pid=".816.0/2">It is not a matter of whether or not we like France as a result of what it has done. It is not a matter of trade-offs: this will not become a just war simply because we say as a trade-off that we will do something about the middle east peace process or that we will tidy up in the aftermath in a very decent way.</p> <p pid=".816.0/3">Let us be clear about the position on UN support. The three original proposers had support from only one other member of the Security Council. Five other states said that they were opposed and there were six swing states. The Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> made a lot of the position of Chile, but it proposed a delay of three weeks and was turned down out of hand by the United States. There are others who have been "unreasonable". Those of us who put a lot of faith in the Prime Minister's promise that war would be regarded as a last resort fear that the Bush Administration have not regarded war as a last resort.</p> <p pid=".816.0/4">The question put to the Prime Minister by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1208" title="Our page on Alex Salmond - &#39;the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)&#39;">Mr. Salmond</a> in respect of the unreasonable veto was not satisfactorily answered. If it was really just a question of France, why did we not put the issue to the Security Council? If the vote had been 14 to one in favour, we could have done what we did with regard to Korea and gone to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly">General Assembly</a> and asked whether we had its support. We know that we would not have done that because we did not have the support of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of Governments in the world, and those Governments who do support us do not have the support of the majority of their population.</p> <p pid=".816.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> Secretary-General, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a>, has suggested that if we go ahead in this form we will be breaching the United Nations charter. I respect the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a>'s view on legality, but we must respect the fact that a wide range of senior international jurists take a different view. Therefore, the only basis on which we could go ahead would be if there was an immediate threat to justify immediate war.</p> <p pid=".816.0/6">Reference has been made to weapons of mass destruction. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> does not only not have nuclear weapons, but, in answer to the point made by my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=975" title="Our page on Alan Howarth - &#39;the Member for Newport, East (Alan Howarth)&#39;">Alan Howarth</a>, Dr. el-Baradei has said that so far he sees no evidence for the suggestion that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has restarted its nuclear weapons programme. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has had most of its biological and chemical weapons—if it still has them, and I suspect it has—for several years. Do we believe that there is an immediate intent to attack the United Kingdom, the United States, neighbouring states or other states?</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".818.3/1">That is very possible. The major threat that is suggested is not that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> intends to attack anyone with such weapons but that it would pass them to terrorist organisations. I have already quoted what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tennet">George Tennet</a> said on behalf of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA">CIA</a> on that, and I repeat that it is important when talking about what connections countries have with terrorism to distinguish between unconditional terrorist organisations, which would be liable to wish to use weapons of mass destruction, and political terrorist organisations, which, however unpleasant or vile, probably would not have a purpose in doing so. I am talking about groups such as the Mujaheddin-e Khalq Organisation and Hamas, with which I accept that there is evidence that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has had connections. As for al-Qaeda, my right hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East referred to evidence given by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaclav_Havel">Vaclav Havel</a>; in fact, Vaclav Havel later said that the information provided no clear evidence of a connection between al-Qaeda and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>.</p> <p pid=".818.3/2">The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said today that the question before us is how Britain and the world face the central security threat of the 21st century. I believe that he was referring to weapons of mass destruction, which brings us to an extremely important point. The general belief in the House has been that we should deal with that problem through a regime of non-proliferation and multilateral disarmament. That has been the common view of UK parties. That does not rule out the possibility of a counter-proliferation strike against a country that is disobeying that regime. However, we have to recognise that the Bush Administration are adopting a wholly different scheme, whereby counter-proliferation, as they call it, takes absolute precedence. In a sense, they are saying, "It is okay if our friends develop nuclear weapons, but not if our enemies do," and they choose who are the friends and who are the enemies. Let us remember that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was regarded as a friend and was supplied during the 1980s, but is now regarded as an enemy. I find that approach capricious and destabilising.</p> <p pid=".818.3/3">Even more worrying is that the policy of the Bush Administration seems to be tending towards saying, "We can develop new nuclear weapons or try to make nuclear weapons more usable, and we can decide to breach the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the security assurance that we gave under that treaty." That is a serious aspect of the overall problem of weapons of mass destruction, especially when it is added to the doctrine of pre-emptive war.</p> <p pid=".818.3/4">I have heard the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> speak twice today, and I apologise for not being able to remember whether he said this at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party or in the House, but it is not an internal party matter in any case. He made the point that war on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was not on his agenda when he became Prime Minister in 1997, and he said that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W">George W</a>. Bush had told him that two days before <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> it was not on his agenda. However, I fear that, long before <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, it was on other people's agenda—namely, that of several of the hawks whom <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush">George Bush</a> appointed to his Administration. Some time ago, I sent hon. Members an e-mail entitled "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Now">Why Now</a>?", which outlined some of the different things that they had said and gave original documents that one can get from various websites.</p> <p pid=".818.3/5">That raises another question. If war with <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was not on the Prime Minister's or the President's agenda in 2001, can we forget that it was not on their agenda for 10 years and say that we have been waiting for 12 years? If full-scale war was not on the agenda, why is it on the agenda now? Is it a logical response to <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>?</p> <p pid=".818.3/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> said that we can view the United States as a major power and seek a rival pole, as a unilateral power or as a partner. I want partnership, but I have doubts. I am not happy about partnership if it means that the United States takes the decision and the rest of us are expected to follow—that to me is not partnership—or if, as seems to be happening, the Bush Administration decide what action should be taken and what should be done immediately, and allow us to supply some of the rhetoric or some of the long-term wish list.</p> <p pid=".818.3/7">If we vote for a pre-emptive war against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> now, we should ask ourselves what precedent we will be setting, because the hawks have already said that they have plans for other pre-emptive divisive wars. We should contrast their plan of the world with the inspirational vision set out by the Prime Minister in Brighton in 2001, when he spoke of</p> <p class="indent" pid=".818.3/8">"the moral power of a world acting as a community".</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".819.0/1">I know that <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1212" title="Our page on Malcolm Savidge - &#39;the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge)&#39;">Mr. Savidge</a> has been waiting to make that speech in a number of debates. He used his time extremely well; it was a very informed contribution. I shall continue directly from one of the points that he made about the new world order into which we are moving.</p> <p pid=".819.0/2">Fundamentally, the debate is not about <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, weapons of mass destruction or even oil, though oil is certainly a factor. The debate is about a new world order, with an unrivalled superpower adopting a doctrine of pre-emptive strike, and how we accommodate that and come to terms with that new world order. Eighteen months ago the United States had an atrocity committed against it and it is still in a trauma. The point was made a few minutes ago, and it is undoubtedly correct: on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-12">12 September 2001</phrase>, the day after the attack on the twin towers, the United States was at its most powerful. In its moment of greatest extremity, the United States was at its zenith. In addition to its unrivalled military might, it carried total moral authority throughout the world. A hundred or more nations signed messages of sympathy, support or solidarity with the extremity that the United States had suffered.</p> <p pid=".819.0/3">Now, 18 months later, that enormous world coalition has been dissipated. I do not take the position that it was only a gang of four who gathered in the Azores. I accept that there are more countries—or at least countries' Governments—who are signed up, but the coalition of the willing for the campaign against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is very narrowly based. Anyone who wants confirmation of that should just count the troops: 300,000 United States and British troops, and I understand that 1,000 Australians have been asked for, and 100 Poles have been offered. That is a very narrowly based coalition indeed.</p> <p pid=".819.0/4">The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> believes, as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North identified, that the way to accommodate the situation is to accept that the United States will be predominant and that the rest must fall into line. They can try to restrain it, but they will have to fall into line with the views of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Administration">United States Administration</a>. That is a wrong-headed policy, and it is taking people into ridiculous positions.</p> <p pid=".819.0/5">In his undoubtedly powerful speech today, the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> argued that the weapons inspection process had never worked. He came close to saying that it had all been a waste of time. I remember a speech on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-02">2 October</phrase> at the Labour conference in which another powerful <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">speaker</a> went into enormous detail to show how successful the weapons inspection process had been in the 1990s and how it had led to the destruction of chemical weapons, the chemicals used to make weapons, the armed warheads and the biological weapons facility. He concluded that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".819.0/6">"the inspections were working even when he"—</p> <p pid=".819.0/7">Saddam Hussein—</p> <p class="indent" pid=".819.0/8">"was trying to thwart them."</p> <p pid=".819.0/9">I watched that speech on television. Many hon. Members were there. The speaker was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bill_Clinton">President Bill Clinton</a>. The television was doing cutaways to Ministers, including the Prime Minister. They were all nodding vigorously last October when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Clinton">President Clinton</a> said that through the 1990s that policy worked and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction than were destroyed, for example, in the Gulf war. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> now seems to be denying what he accepted only last October.</p> <p pid=".819.0/10">We are told that the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the Security Council would have voted for the second resolution, if it had not been for the nasty French coming in at the last minute and scuppering the whole process. Let us get real. Have we listened to what other countries were saying? The Chileans proposed an extension of three weeks, but they were told by the United States that that was not on. In the debate in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly">General Assembly</a>, country after country expressed their anxieties about not letting the weapons inspectors have a chance to do their work. They were told that the nasty French—I am not sure whether the Conservative party dislikes the French more than the Liberals, or vice versa—were being extremely unreasonable, but the French position, and the Chinese position—</p></div>

Somebody should speak up for the French, because their position has been consistent, as has that of the Russians and the Chinese. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a>, the French and the Russians issued a declaration on the passage of resolution 1441. It sets out exactly how the British and the United States ambassadors agreed that it was not a trigger for war. The reason that those countries did not want a second resolution was not that it would be a pathway to peace—I wonder who dreamed that up in Downing street. The reason was that they saw it as a passport to war, so obviously they opposed a resolution drawn in those terms. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament.

Everything has been consistent in the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> of countries that are against a rush to military action.</p> <p pid=".821.3/2">Will the approach that is being taken work? The argument is that it will be a salutary lesson, that a dictator will be taught a lesson and that that will help us in dealing with other dictators. I suspect that the cost of the action—I do not doubt the military outcome for a second—will be so high in a number of ways that it will not provide a platform for an assault on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a> or Iran, which form the rest of the "axis of evil". I do not think that the policy of teaching one dictator a lesson and then moving on to other dictators can work. Most of us know that it will be a breeding ground for a future generation of terrorists. That is not the case because people like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. The images that will be shown throughout the Muslim world will not feature him, although, without any question, he will be more attractive as a martyr when he is dead than he has ever been while alive. The images that will be shown are those of the innocents who will undoubtedly die in a conflict that will be a breeding ground for terrorism.</p> <p pid=".821.3/3">Will the nation-building work? The record of the United States on nation-building has not been impressive. Let me say something about one of the other countries that is being reviled at present—Germany, which commits far more troops as a percentage of its armed forces to helping to secure the peace in the various trouble spots of the world for the United Nations.</p> <p pid=".821.3/4">We are told that the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>—this is the essence of his case—will try to restrain some elements in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Administration">United States Administration</a> and make them take a multilateral approach, but that, if that does not happen, when push comes to shove he has to go along with their policy. I say that there is a broader United States of America than the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government">United States Government</a>. I believe that many sections of opinion in America would welcome a vote from this Parliament today that says "Not in our name", because the real America wants to see a stand for peace, not a rush for war.</p></div>

Friend to read the words of the chief weapons inspector, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a>, because he—[Hon. Members: "Answer!"] If hon. Members will listen, they will find that I am answering the question. Hans Blix is quite clear that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> remains in breach. Indeed, every member of the Security Council is quite clear that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> remains in breach, and that there has been no full, immediate or unconditional compliance. There is an option to go down the containment route, and some hon. Members have suggested that in their speeches today. It is not an option that I agree with. I believe that we have to maintain what we said at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> in resolution 1441, which was that we have to disarm <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".823.5/2">There are those who have said that they cannot now support military action because there has been no second resolution in the United Nations. That is the worst reason of all for not supporting it. If it were right to engage in military action, to kill innocent Iraqi people and to put our troops on the line to die for this country with the support of a second resolution at the United Nations, it has to be morally right to do so without one. The morality of our actions does not depend on who is prepared to carry out those actions with us; it depends on the judgment that we make about whether it is right or wrong. The Government are taking the right course of action. It is the only course of action that will achieve the disarmament of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, and disarmament is the only way of ensuring that a further, far more bloody conflict does not happen in the future.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".824.0/1">I plan to reach the same destination as <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=905" title="Our page on Barry Gardiner - &#39;the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner)&#39;">Mr. Gardiner</a>, but I propose to take a slightly different route.</p> <p pid=".824.0/2">We are witnessing the most spectacular failure of diplomacy in my political lifetime. Here we are with the most sophisticated, best-resourced international institutions that the world has ever seen, peopled by the most civilised, best-educated diplomats in history, assisted by every modern communication device that technology can provide, and working at a time when many of the barriers that used to divide the world have come down—yet they have failed, with the inevitable apocalyptic consequences for <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".824.0/3">First, those close to Iraq—those who may take a different view from that of the United States and the United Kingdom—have totally failed to convince Saddam that his country and his people were going to be hit hard by American and British troops, and that he would be annihilated, unless he agreed to what was being put before him. Many thought that Saddam would <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a> at the last moment, obliging the American and British troops to go home and leave him in control, without a regime change. But those close to Saddam, geographically and culturally, have failed to bring home to him the fate that lies in store, and that is the first diplomatic failure.</p> <p pid=".824.0/4">The second failure is more important. The world's democracies have failed to get their act together to present a coherent and united front to an obnoxious regime. It is that institutional failure, rather than the underlying case against Saddam, that has led to the equivocal response from public opinion.</p> <p pid=".824.0/5">We will need to revisit the whole architecture of international institutional peacekeeping, and re-engineer it radically to avoid future failure. I do not give that as a reason for going to war, but I happen to believe it will be easier to make the reforms that are necessary once the <span class="hi">Iraq</span> crisis has been resolved, than to do so with the crisis hanging over the United Nations indefinitely.</p> <p pid=".824.0/6">I believe there was a need for greater clarity at the inception of the resolution process, a need for more visible and better-defined milestones as we went along, and for greater certainty about the nature of the consequences if there was no progress. The traditional skills of diplomacy involve getting people to agree to something by persuading them that it means what they want it to mean, and saying that there is no harm in "signing up" because the eventuality is remote. All that has come horribly unstuck. There has been too much ambiguity and obfuscation in the process.</p> <p pid=".824.0/7">The public squabbling about what resolution 1441 actually means baffles our constituents, as do discussions on "Newsnight" and "Today" between expensive barristers about whether the war is legal. I believe that if the process had been more open and transparent—if there had been more clarity—we would be receiving a more supportive response from our constituents, because the underlying case is strong.</p> <p pid=".824.0/8">That, however, is for tomorrow. What should we do today? I agree with my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1075" title="Our page on Andrew MacKay - &#39;the Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay)&#39;">Mr. Mackay</a> that the decision is close to call. I believe that, in a nutshell, the debate concerns the credibility of the United Nations on the one hand, and its unity on the other. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s view is that unless firm action is taken now, the UN's credibility will be fatally undermined. The alternative view is that moving too fast will shatter the unity of the UN, thus fatally undermining it.</p> <p pid=".824.0/9">With the benefit of hindsight, we may think it might have been possible for the United States and the United Kingdom to go a little more slowly, not to give Saddam more time, but to give the rest of the world more time. That is not possible now, though. The unity of the UN is no longer there—which makes it more important to assert its credibility.</p> <p pid=".824.0/10">When we last debated this issue I had some sympathy with the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that had been tabled, but I did not support it, for this reason: the best prospect for peace at that time was convincing Saddam that we were prepared to go to war. It seemed to me that the more people voted for the amendment, the more Saddam would get a picture of a country that was not prepared to go to war. Voting for the amendment ran the risk of encouraging Saddam to call the bluff. Having looked at the amendment tabled today, I feel that anyone who genuinely believes that the case for war has not been established should vote against the war. The amendment seeks to square a circle that is incapable of being squared.</p> <p pid=".824.0/11">Whatever the doubts and reservations about the process that brought us here, here we are. My <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, like others, has a high military profile. Many of my voters are sitting on the hot yellow sand in Kuwait, wondering whether they will see the cool green fields of Hampshire again. I believe that they and their families are entitled to know that their <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> backs the risks they run in removing an obnoxious regime, and I shall therefore support the Government tonight.</p></div>

I did not start with the view that we should necessarily take military action in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Naturally, I have spent a good deal of time listening to the criticisms of those who are worried about the prospect of war. It has occurred to me that there have been a number of recurring themes in the arguments of those who believe that we should not go to war. Obviously, nothing I say will have any impact on those who are already implacably opposed to war, but over the past few days many colleagues have told me that they are not sure about it, because they feel that the issue is very finely balanced. I wondered which matters people were not certain about. I regularly hear that the case regarding weapons of mass destruction has not been made. Some people are certain that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> has none at all, and others say that he has neither the capability nor the capacity to use them.</p> <p pid=".825.0/3">How did we end up in this position? We must assume either that my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> is misleading the House whenever he comes to the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you&#39;ve ever seen inside the Commons, you&#39;ll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> to talk about his fear of those weapons of mass destruction and about the intelligence reports that he has been reviewing, or that the intelligence community is deliberately misinforming him. We must draw those conclusions if we say that the story about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD">WMD</a> is utterly wrong. Moreover, whenever there is a report from a respected journalist that a scientist has been assassinated or detained because he has knowledge of the weapons programme, we must believe that that journalist is seeking to mislead us.</p> <p pid=".825.0/4">Last week, my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a> arranged for representatives of the INDICT organisation to come to the House.

After those people have been subjected to every sort of torture and humiliation, they are then gassed with mustard gas. Where does all that mustard gas come from, if all that sort of stuff has been degraded or destroyed? We cannot assume that there are no WMD in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. The inspectors' reports repeatedly indicate that there are.</p> <p pid=".825.0/5">We do not know with any certainty the extent to which WMD exist, but anyone who believes that Saddam Hussein has no such weapons, and no viable chemical or biological weapons, should not vote for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> tonight. I agree with <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1344" title="Our page on George Young - &#39;the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)&#39;">Sir George Young</a>: anyone who honestly believes that Saddam Hussein has no weapons of that variety should vote straightforwardly against the Government motion. In those circumstances, it would be absurd to vote for the amendment.</p> <p pid=".825.0/6">People have been preoccupied by the question of the additional UN resolution. I have been troubled by the way in which that resolution has been regarded. For weeks, there has been a systematic effort from certain quarters to convince people that any such resolution would have been irrelevant anyway, as it would have been secured by buying people off, or by arm twisting. No hon. Members who are party to the view that the resolution would have been worthless anyway have a right to come to the House and say that they will not vote for the motion because that resolution was not secured.</p> <p pid=".825.0/7">I happen to be one of those who believe that the Government were right to try to secure a second resolution. I commend the efforts of my right hon. Friend the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to go the full distance to try and achieve that, but it would be absurd to put to the vote a resolution that has effectively been blown out of the water already. There is no getting away from the fact that that was the consequence of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_President">French President</a>'s behaviour.</p> <p pid=".825.0/8">We have therefore been left without a second resolution and, as a result, Saddam has been given a further advantage. We might have been able to say today that we were all at one about how to deal with the man, but we find ourselves sidetracked into dealing with the question of the resolution. The second resolution in itself is important only if we disregard everything that went before, but the reality is that there have been umpteen resolutions in the past 12 years. For a full year, the House has had virtually no other topic for debate than the question of what we should do about Saddam.</p> <p pid=".825.0/9">Some hon. Members say that they would have supported the Government under other circumstances, but that the lack of a second resolution—a resolution which, a couple of weeks ago, the same people were calling dubious—has made the decision for them. With all due respect to the people involved, that is an extremely hard case to believe.</p> <p pid=".825.0/10">The other question that I have pondered is why the situation is suddenly different now. I read the amendment with interest, but it is the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Groundhog Day</a>" scenario. It says that, despite everything that has happened, we want to go back to the beginning and start again. The amendment is saying, "Well, we think that Saddam might have some weapons and the UN might be well advised to take some action against him, but we think that the Prime Minister should start all over again and see whether he can get another resolution. If he gets a resolution this time, however, we think it should give Saddam an unspecified period of time." The amendment calls it a "defined period", but that could mean three days, 30 days or 30 years. Those who support the amendment think that we should start again, allow everything that has already happened to happen again and then, if we are no further forward, consider military action.</p> <p pid=".825.0/11">I am no fan of the prospect of military action, but the time has come to draw a line if we are to justify what we have said. The talking must end and we must show that our intent is real. Any other course of action diminishes everything that has happened.</p> <p pid=".825.0/12">Many people have raised the legitimate point that there are two issues that we cannot walk away from. If we resort to military action—</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".827.1/1">It is pleasure to speak in such a full Chamber. My normal lot is to speak when the Chamber is almost empty, which is probably a good thing. I am afraid that when the gift of making good speeches was handed out I must have been somewhere else, but I shall try to explain why I intend to vote for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> tonight. I shall do so with a heavy heart, and the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty&#39;s Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> nearly persuaded me to vote with them. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1016" title="Our page on Charles Kennedy - &#39;the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy)&#39;">Mr. Kennedy</a> nearly persuaded me not to vote with him.</p> <p pid=".827.1/2">There are many reasons for my decision and I cannot give them all. One of the principal reasons is the action in Yugoslavia, which I opposed. Although I understand the reasons given by other hon. Members—notably my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=999" title="Our page on Boris Johnson - &#39;the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)&#39;">Mr. Johnson</a>—I find it disturbing that that action has been portrayed recently in debate as a great victory and success. Anybody who knows the current situation in Kosovo will realise that we certainly have not finished what we started. It is one of my great worries that the same will happen in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".827.1/3">Enough has been said in some excellent speeches, but I have lost my faith in what happens in war because in the past the truth has been blatantly abused by our propagandists. I do not seek to make a party political point, but I thought that our Government were above that. If we want to keep the faith and trust of other countries, we must not try to hide the truth. Military considerations aside, we must try to tell the truth.</p> <p pid=".827.1/4">This is a difficult decision. Although I would normally say that the Whips are a fine body of men and women, and it is usually a good idea to do exactly what they say, on this occasion I suggest to all hon. Members that it is best to make up their own minds. Those who are voting with the Government are not warmongers; those of us who are voting for the amendment are not appeasers. Everyone has their own opinions and it is very difficult to come down on one side of the fence.</p> <p pid=".827.1/5">America is not a villain. I would like to count myself as a friend of America. However, as all good friends should, we sometimes have to speak out and tell our friends that they are doing something that they should perhaps think twice about. All I mean by that is that they should just hold back a little longer. I can understand that the military build-up is like water behind a dam. We cannot keep it there forever. That is why I think that what is going to happen is inevitable.</p> <p pid=".827.1/6">I was brought up to believe in serving my country. I also believe in doing my duty. My duty is first and foremost to my country, then to my <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, and then to my party. However, one of the things that I have always been frightened of in the Whips Office is when people listen to the arguments. Listening to the arguments today has been a salutary lesson. Another expression that we have in the Whips Office is, "I'm afraid I'm all over the place."</p> <p pid=".827.1/7">Many of my constituents from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Uxbridge">RAF Uxbridge</a> are already in the Gulf, and many others will soon join them. The last thing that I want is for them to feel that I am undermining them. If the amendment falls, I shall seriously consider the political and moral gymnastics of whether I can support the Government. I am not sure at this stage whether I can do that, but I can promise my constituents out there that I wish them well. Once I have said my piece, I shall shut up and let them get on with their job. I hope—I have never hoped this so much in my life—that I am wrong about some of the possible consequences. I will be the first to admit that, if I am wrong, I shall be delighted.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".828.1/1">There was a quiet eloquence about the hon. Gentleman in spite of his disclaimer. What I liked about his speech was his considerable respect for those on both sides of the argument and his readiness to express honest doubt. I have felt little respect for those who have total confidence in either side of the argument. There are many high risks and many uncertainties, and many questions that have not been answered—indeed, there are some questions that cannot, as yet, be answered. However, we are not a university debating society and we are not a seminar of professors. We have to make decisions. People will make decisions, exercising their judgment as best they can.</p> <p pid=".828.1/2">We are faced with this problem as we seek to come to a decision: should we now stand down our troops, and should we fundamentally change our strategy? In theory, we could indeed fold our tents and glide away, forgetting about the fact that there are men and women representing our country on the borders of Kuwait and <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. We have chosen to be engaged. In my judgment, we made a correct strategic decision way back last summer. We remain engaged with our US allies. To withdraw at this stage would be unthinkable. To suggest that we could was the essential flaw in the argument of my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - &#39;the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)&#39;">Mr. Cook</a> last night. His speech was highly compelling. Moreover, he has, in a short time, made a major and positive impact on the procedures of the House and on the House generally. The fact is, however, that we cannot easily now turn back without undermining our own credibility and the authority of the United Nations. The wording of 1441 was clear. One does not need any special knowledge to know that "immediate" should mean immediate and that "unconditional" should mean unconditional. Only in an Alice in Wonderland world do words mean what I say they mean: elsewhere, the word "immediate" must surely mean immediate. After four and a half months, Dr. el-Baradei said clearly that there would have to be a dramatic change on the part of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> if there was to be compliance. Given Saddam Hussein's record, one would need faith in a Damascene conversion to imagine that such a dramatic change was likely to happen. It was reasonable to assume that the words meant what they said. If we backtrack now, no future Security Council resolutions will have any credibility. We can make all sorts of pious declarations but a giant leap will be required if there is not the will to enforce them.</p> <p pid=".828.1/3">I turn to the role of my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. He promised in good faith to pursue the diplomatic path, and he has indeed gone the extra mile, as many of us demanded. The Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> undertook to make possible a debate in this House before action. That was wholly unprecedented and wholly against all the practices and conventions of our constitution. I applaud his having done so; it is a major victory for Parliament. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> stated clearly that he wished to act in conformity with international law—of course, there are weighty lawyers on both sides, but the opinion of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> is very clear on this point; not one Member of this House could have tried harder than the Prime Minister to continue negotiations to avoid war; not one Member could have shown more commitment or more courage.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".830.0/1">Perhaps my hon. Friend should see a lawyer. I have confidence in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a>. He chaired the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Council">Bar Council</a>, he has his reputation among his fellow lawyers to maintain, and he is a man of stout independence. I urge my hon. Friend to look carefully at the conclusions that he reached.</p> <p pid=".830.0/2">Our <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> made a strategic decision to stand alongside the United States on the basis that it would give him influence—it certainly has given him influence in terms of the UN route and of the middle east peace process—and on the basis that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, given his past conduct, only responds to pressure with the credible threat of force. I am confident that that was the correct decision at the time. We could not have foreseen that the UN route could lead to the current impasse. One or two hon. Members have spoken of a spectacular failure of diplomacy, but all the advice available to our Government—not only from our diplomats but from conversations with leading members—was that there was a likelihood that 1441 would be obeyed.</p> <p pid=".830.0/3">The US has many vocal critics—I have frequently raised my concerns about its unilateralist policies in other areas—but the blame for the collapse of the diplomatic process lies with the wilful obstruction of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Government">French Government</a>, who said in terms:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".830.0/4">"Quelles que soient les circonstances la France votera non".</p> <p pid=".830.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French">The French</a> is clear: whatever the circumstances, France will vote no. There is nothing clearer than that. The French ruled out negotiations on the proposals put forward by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> even before the Iraqis did. That approach, which has led to a crisis in the international organisations and put at risk the transatlantic alliance, is based essentially on a Gaullist view of the world—the idea that Europe can be an effective rival or counterweight to the megapower of the United States. France has played into the hands of Saddam Hussein by blocking the UN route. Do we seriously expect Saddam Hussein to make concessions and to co-operate with the weapons inspectors now that the pressure has been taken off him—or would have been taken off him if the French had had their way? In short, France has dealt a mortal blow to any hopes of a peaceful, negotiated outcome.</p> <p pid=".830.0/6">I recognise the uncertainties and the high risks, and I share many of my colleagues' suspicions about the unilateralism of the US Administration. However, I am confident that the French position can only encourage that unilateralism, while our policy will help to keep the US engaged internationally, and will ensure our national influence for the good. Despite all the uncertainties and anxieties, I fully supported the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> when he lined up with the President to disarm Saddam Hussein voluntarily, or by force. That was done for the best motives, and on the basis of a correct analysis at the time, and it has had significant results. Disarmament is now impossible through the preferred route, so serious consequences are now imminent and inevitable. In my judgment, if we prevaricate, we lose credibility. To uphold the UN's credibility, we should hold our course. I shall support the Government tonight.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".831.0/1">We could be at war in days, if not hours, and in meeting here today, we have perhaps one last chance to reflect on that fact. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has set out a powerful case. We can all understand his commitment and applaud his efforts; unfortunately, we cannot support his conclusions. Many of today's contributions have reflected the passions and concerns surrounding this issue. The House will, of course, unite on one key issue: that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> is an evil tyrant who should not be in possession of weapons of mass destruction; he must be disarmed. The fault line in the debate is about how we do that. We take him on because he ignores international law, and in so doing we must respect the principles of international law, in whose name we act. War must be a last resort.</p> <p pid=".831.0/2">We believe that the military build-up was the right thing to do. Saddam and his regime have undoubtedly had their minds focused, but an important distinction surely exists between a credible threat of force, and the certain use of force. We must not go to war simply because the forces have turned up and are ready to roll. Resolution 1441 contained no automaticity. It was, of course, a significant achievement, and all the more powerful because it was unanimous. It did indeed talk about a "further material breach", a "final opportunity", and "serious consequences". We are all familiar with the litany; indeed, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> can quote it unsighted, and has firm views on its meaning.</p> <p pid=".831.0/3">However, there is one part of resolution 1441, in paragraph 12, that often gets overlooked. It states that the Security Council</p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/4">"Decides to convene immediately upon receipt of a report in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 11 . . . in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance".</p> <p pid=".831.0/5">In weighing up the best way to tackle Saddam, it is the Security Council as a whole that must judge the course of action to take. The Government's efforts in recent days to persuade Security Council members about their course of action shows that they recognise this truth; however, their arguments have not prevailed. The core of 1441 is about the weapons inspectors. Doctors Blix and el-Baradei have made progress. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_and_UK">US and UK</a> Governments may not be persuaded, but that does not alter the position. Dr. Blix said recently that the time allowed "is a little short". He also said that he needed</p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/6">"not years, not weeks, but months".</p> <p pid=".831.0/7">The process set out in 1441 is not exhausted; alternatives to war have barely been explored. In the past few days, we have seen diplomacy laid bare, considered discussion subverted by shouting matches, and force of argument now replaced by force of arms. It has been ugly, but the downward spiral of international debate must not distract us from the underlying truths of the situation. The Governments of the USA and the UK have not won the arguments; not simply because a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> in the international community believe that the weapons inspectors should continue their work but, just as significantly, because there is disagreement about the war objectives—disarmament only, or regime change. There is also concern about the consequences of action, which could be horrific and extremely serious, whether in humanitarian terms in the middle east region or through a spur to international terrorism. All those issues weigh heavily on us and they should tip the argument towards continuing with the UN route.</p> <p pid=".831.0/8">We are not yet at war, but in all likelihood our armed forces will be engaged in military conflict in the next few days. Our thoughts are with them and their families. As the cross-party <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> notes, in the event that hostilities commence, we pledge total support for the British forces. We express admiration for their courage, skill and devotion to duty, and hope that their tasks will be swiftly concluded with minimal casualties on all sides.</p> <p pid=".831.0/9">We still have a final moment for reflection. Late last week, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> issued a plea. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/10">"Let us move beyond entrenched positions and make moves for peace."</p> <p pid=".831.0/11">He was talking about the middle east peace process, but his words also apply to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. We should still be working through the United Nations. We have not yet exhausted all the diplomatic and political alternatives.</p> <p pid=".831.0/12">We should not be going to war.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".832.0/1">I shall talk about only one aspect of this issue: the humanitarian consequences of the action of my Government and the United States in going to war on <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".832.0/2">In this debate we have been obsessed, as we have been for many months, with the wickedness of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. There have been countless words of vilification, but for my constituents they were hardly necessary; they are fully aware of his behaviour. What bothers my constituents—it is one of the reasons why the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> fails to persuade them of the rightness of his approach—is that little or no attention is being paid to the consequences of the action that we are about to take.</p> <p pid=".832.0/3">If damaging consequences are set loose by our actions, we must take the morality of that into account. If, as we are likely to do, we take action that strongly increases the probability of the use of weapons of mass destruction, we must question whether such a policy is wise or moral. If we take action that involves the use of our own weapons of mass destruction in a horrific onslaught against the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, that, too, has to be put on the moral scales. Half the people whom we are going to kill are children. None of the people whom we are going to kill had any say in the imposition of Saddam Hussein as their tyrant. We must take that into account.</p> <p pid=".832.0/4">We are going to invade a country of Balkanesque complexity where occupying forces will be unable easily to withdraw. We are rapidly in danger of becoming piggy in the middle for every discontented ethnic or religious group in the area. There seems little doubt of speedy, initial victory, but it is worth remembering that the six-day war in the middle east is still going strong after 35 years. This war has similar potential.</p> <p pid=".832.0/5">It is currently not easy to get countries to volunteer for armed service in Afghanistan. Which countries will have troops of the right quality to assist the Americans and us? Have we faced up to being an army of occupation?</p> <p pid=".832.0/6">Above all, we are being led by an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_President">American President</a> who is completely honest about what his Administration intend to do with the world. I have recently been reading <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Woodward">Bob Woodward</a>'s book, "Bush at War"—on his first war in Afghanistan—which is a real love story. Bob Woodward says of Bush:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".832.0/7">"His vision clearly includes a radical reordering of the world through pre-emptive and, if necessary, unilateral action."</p> <p pid=".832.0/8">We have not just to look at the history, as we keep doing, but to think through the consequences.</p> <p pid=".832.0/9">I have been concerned by the lack of reporting to the House on the humanitarian consequences of an invasion. When I backed the Government in going down the UN route, the intention was certainly not that we would just debate and vote in the Security Council and then the <span class="hi">Iraq</span> issue would be simply handed over to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Tommy_Franks">General Tommy Franks</a>. Obviously, the conduct of the war has to be done by the military, but what happens alongside and afterwards must be an UN operation.</p> <p pid=".832.0/10">The Government have been very remiss in reporting on what the operation will involve. The only people who have been clear about what will happen are the Americans, and they did so most clearly five to six weeks ago in a report to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Foreign_Relations_Committee">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Feith">Douglas Feith</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Secretary">Under Secretary</a> of Defence.</p> <p pid=".832.0/11"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon">The Pentagon</a> would be in control. I quote:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".832.0/12">"US post war responsibilities will not be easy to fulfil and the US by no means wishes to tackle them alone. We shall encourage contributions and participation from coalition partners, non-governmental organisations, the UN and other international organisations and others."</p> <p pid=".832.0/13">Another quote:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".832.0/14">"The coalition officials"— that is us—</p> <p class="indent" pid=".832.0/16">"responsible for post-conflict administration of Iraq—whether military or civilian, from the various agencies of governments, will report to the President through General Tom Franks and the Secretary of Defense."</p> <p pid=".832.0/17">That is simply not acceptable as a way of administering a country that has been invaded. That is not conjecture; it is a statement of policy by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Government">American Government</a>. The expectation is that the Americans, not the UN, would have the lead role and that foreign Governments and organisations would report to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_President">United States President</a>. That had been planned without reference to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_UN">Secretary-General of the UN</a> or any UN organisation.</p> <p pid=".832.0/18">Stories are now going around that, in fact, the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has negotiated the lead role for the UN under a new UN resolution that will be proposed. I am puzzled by that story because it is not in the motion and it was not in the Prime Minister's speech. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is not in the motion. If hon. Members read the motion, they will see that it does not refer to a UN-controlled mandate post-conflict. If that is there, it is very welcome. If it is true—this story is going around as well—that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> will be in charge of the oil-for-food programme, that is a big step forward, but perhaps the Minister would tell us in his winding-up speech exactly what has been negotiated with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush">George Bush</a> to make the situation much more acceptable when the conflict is over, rather than what is in the motion at present. I would very much welcome that.</p> <p pid=".832.0/19">We have to consider the scale of the humanitarian problem. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is a huge country, the size of France. We have to think about feeding 26 million people instantly. That has to be done by the UN, not by the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance after the election. No one has paid any attention to that very important issue, but I hope that the Minister will be able to make it absolutely clear in his winding-up speech whether the UN or the American generals will be in control after the election.</p></div>

First, war should always be the measure of last resort, when all other approaches have been exhausted and are futile. Indeed, war can be justified only if there is no other possibility. As we stand today, however, that is not the case. The threat of force is yielding some results. UN inspectors want more time and are finally making some progress, slow though it may be, and no one can dispute that.</p> <p pid=".834.0/2">Many who advocate war point out correctly that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has had 12 years to disarm but has not done so, and cite that as a reason to go to war now. However, many of those years were wasted by the international community. To resort to war now, having made some progress during the last 12 to 13 weeks of the present policy, makes little sense.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".834.2/1">I accept my hon. Friend's point, but he must accept that the UN inspectors' reports request extra time because they believe that some progress is being made and there are tentative signs that the regime may be changing its view. An extra 45 days, or a couple of months, would determine whether that was true. Time would tell.</p> <p pid=".834.2/2">To wage war now makes little sense when all the other possible approaches and measures have not been exhausted. Waging war is the ultimate act of politicians, yet such an act recognises the futility of their endeavours. Until we know that all other avenues have been exhausted, our consciences cannot be at ease. What is to be lost by giving the UN inspectors what they want: a few more months to see whether the task can be completed? Do we seriously believe that <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> biological and chemical weapons, in whatever state and quantity, pose such an immediate threat to the US, the UK or <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> neighbours that if we do not act this week or this month, we put our citizens at serious risk? I do not believe so.</p> <p pid=".834.2/3"><span class="hi">Iraq's</span> army is a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> of its 1991 standing. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is probably the most watched-over country in the world at present. It would not pose any more of an immediate threat to our citizens during this period than it has done over the past 12 years. The prize for being patient, however, could be great: we would have a much greater chance of the UN speaking with at least a moral <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a>, if not one voice, on this issue.</p> <p pid=".834.2/4">That leads me to my second concern, which is for the UN. For whatever reasons, it is clear that the UN does not believe war to be justified, and will not vote for it. Unlike the action in relation to Kosovo, we cannot even get a moral majority for this action. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> imposed the sanctions, and, on this issue, the UN should decide whether war is a necessity. By taking unilateral action, the US and the UK have undermined the organisation, which saddens me greatly. Having served with the UN, I have seen the tremendous potential for good that it possesses. It is not perfect, and blame can be laid at its door over the last 12 years, but it is the best that we have got, and could do much more if we put our minds to it. At a time when the UN should come together as never before to fight global terrorism and other threats after <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, it is being undermined by this action. The credibility that the international community will require when dealing with rogue states and terrorist organisations will be that much harder to muster.</p> <p pid=".834.2/5">Since the second world war, the threat of force, deterrence and containment have been successful policies, during the cold war and when dealing with rogue states such as Libya. The broad unity that has made that possible is at risk of fracturing, and that could be a serious consequence of this action.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".835.1/1">I will not. I must make progress or I will run out of time.</p> <p pid=".835.1/2">We have debated the broad legality of the action long and hard, and I accept that, if one puts several lawyers in a room, one will probably not receive only one answer. Resolution 1441, for which I voted, clearly implies that war is possible, but only if other means have been exhausted. I thought that it was passed in that spirit and, as we all know, the American ambassador to the UN was at pains to emphasise at the time that there were no hidden trigger points for war in the resolution. However, we have been told that the resolution is sufficient justification for war in its own right. If that is the case, certain questions must be answered.</p> <p pid=".835.1/3">Why did the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_and_UK">US and UK</a> try to secure a second resolution if not to provide legal cover for war? Why has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> cast doubt over the legality of war without a second resolution? Why does a growing body of opinion, both at home and abroad, question whether resolution 1441 is sufficient justification for war? The countries that signed up to 1441 believed that it could justify war only if there were no alternatives. We all agree that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has a revolting regime—there can be little doubt about that—but that is insufficient justification to go to war.</p> <p pid=".835.1/4">Insufficient thought has been given to the consequences of the action and <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=19" title="An Urgent Question, formerly a Private Notice Question (PNQ), is a question..." class="glossary">urgent questions</a> must again be answered. Who and what will replace <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>? What plans exist for humanitarian relief? We know little about that. What effect will the action have on the stability of neighbouring states? My right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has consistently asked those questions but the Government have failed to answer them, broadly speaking. Any plans have not been assisted by the fact that the USA has cited different objectives at different times: regime change, links with al-Qaeda, weapons of mass destruction and morality. We need to be clear about the objectives when taking such important decisions.</p> <p pid=".835.1/5">I wish to address the view expressed in some quarters that we are somehow letting our troops down by questioning our policy here and now. It is only right that we question the policy given that we are probably about to go to war. I am sure that I speak for everyone in the House when I say that we will wholeheartedly support our troops if and when they are sent to war. They deserve our fullest support and I know that they will not fail us, although we may have failed to address the issue adequately.</p> <p pid=".835.1/6">War now is not the right action. I have no doubt about the result of the conflict because the combined military power of the US and the UK will ensure a quick military victory. However, an easy victory does not make the war right. I am not anti-American—quite the opposite, I have great respect for America—but that is not the issue. Good friends need to point out where policy is going wrong.</p> <p pid=".835.1/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> can only be weakened by unilateral action by certain members at a time when it clearly does not believe that action is justified, despite all the talk over the weekend in the Azores. That is why I cannot support the Government's action and I shall vote for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p></div>

I also hope that men, women and children in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will be safe. With apologies to Churchill, I hope that this will not signal the end, or even the beginning of the end, for our <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. However, my gut instinct tells me that he will face almost insurmountable problems because of the position that he has taken. The scale of his misjudgment on this issue is enormous.</p> <p pid=".836.0/3">Who would have thought that the actions of a Labour Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> would have given rise to the biggest demonstration in our history against his own Government? Who would have thought that his actions would give rise to the biggest parliamentary Back-Bench rebellion in modern political history? How did he manage to poison the idea of European unity? The attempts to make France the scapegoat for the miserable failure of British diplomacy have demeaned both our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>—I regret to say that—and our Prime Minister. Listening to some of today's debate, one would think that there is such an anti-French feeling that people have started to read the editorials in <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun">The Sun</a></i>. It will be a long time before the civilised citizens of our continent forgive them.</p> <p pid=".836.0/4">How came it that our Prime Minister allowed a road map for peace to become a road map for war, thereby sowing deep <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> in the United Nations? Did he really think that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government">United States Government</a> could bully and bribe all the nations of the UN to acquiesce in armed conflict? It is sad that, both as a politician and as a lawyer, the Prime Minister should have forsaken the ideal of a tolerant and liberal internationalism in favour of the frightening concept that might is right.</p> <p pid=".836.0/5">We are supposed to admire the Prime Minister because he is a man without doubts and one shorn of scepticism—two of the greatest qualities that the British people have. He just knows that he is right and is therefore prepared to ignore the advice of virtually all the leaders of the great religions in the world, including the Pope and our own archbishop. I find that approach rather frightening.</p> <p pid=".836.0/6">Worse than all that, the Prime Minister shows himself to be oblivious of and careless towards the shrewd moral judgment of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the British people. No, we do not govern by opinion poll and focus groups, but in a modern democracy we need something stronger to hold on to than the slogan, "My Prime Minister, right or wrong."</p> <p pid=".836.0/7">In this catastrophe the Prime Minister, a self-avowed admirer of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_Thatcher">Baroness Thatcher</a>, has ignored the principal lesson of her demise. He should know, as the rest of us do, that when arrogance turns to hubris, come-uppance is never far behind.</p></div>

So do I. Shortly after <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> did use chemical weapons of mass destruction against his own people, I sought to go to <span class="hi">Iraq</span> with my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a> and a chemical weapons expert to find out just what had happened. I do not remember any of us being given any support, either by the then Government or by the then <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>. The heroic efforts of my hon. Friend, for whom I have unstinting admiration, to help the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurds">Iraqi Kurds</a>, were met with her dismissal by the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> on the advice of the then Labour <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=8" title="The government chief whip, whose official title is parliamentary secretary..." class="glossary">Chief Whip</a> . I find that appalling.</p> <p pid=".837.1/3">More recently, my hon. Friend has been thwarted by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> in her attempts, as an alternative to war, to indict Saddam Hussein and his henchmen for crimes against humanity. The Attorney-General's response, as my hon. Friend told the House in withering terms, was woeful. His legal opinion, which I have seen myself, was scorned by experts.</p> <p pid=".837.1/4">So now it is to be war on the basis of another bad legal opinion by the Attorney-General. I have it here in my pocket. I do not want to be rude to the Attorney-General, but he is a commercial lawyer who, frankly, seems to be out of his depth when trying to deal with this problem. Let us not forget too—I apologise to my learned Friends for this—that the law is a marketplace and if one shops around, one can always get some poor soul to give the opinion that one wants.</p> <p pid=".837.1/5">Of course there are <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>, domestic and international, and they should be adhered to, but it takes people of clarity and understanding at the top to enable systems to work fairly and properly. In my view, we lack such people at the moment. History frequently tells us that tragedies are rarely as bad as they seem at the time they occur; ominously, however, it sometimes tells us that they are worse. I suspect that the latter will prove to be the case this time. In the end, politics, like most other things in life, is about trust. Sadly, I do not trust some of the people who are leading us in this issue, so they cannot rely on my support tonight.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".838.0/1">That was fairly indigestible. <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1215" title="Our page on Brian Sedgemore - &#39;The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore)&#39;">Mr. Sedgemore</a> indulged his usual understatement, but apparently one can safely make that sort of speech from inside the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> as well as outside.</p> <p pid=".838.0/2">I shall pick up the point about legality and spend a few minutes examining it. Seventeen United Nations Security council resolutions and the opinion of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> are enough for me—although apparently not for some people—and I cannot see how one more resolution can make moral something that is otherwise immoral. However, to examine the issue strictly in terms of legality, the opinion of the Attorney-General seems to me powerful and well argued. No doubt, as the hon. Gentleman said, if one got a different lawyer, one would get a different opinion. I note that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> commissioned an opinion from a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=139" title="A barrister appointed to senior rank by the Lord Chancellor. When the..." class="glossary">QC</a> and got an opinion that was precisely the opposite of the Attorney-General's. How surprising. There is no point in paying one of those expensive people if they are not going to say what one wants to hear.</p> <p pid=".838.0/3">I wish to explore the views of many of those who are rebelling against the Government over <span class="hi">Iraq</span> but were perfectly content with the action that the Government took in Kosovo. We did not get even one <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> resolution for Kosovo. We relied on a doctrine of so-called humanitarian <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> that almost certainly does not exist—certainly the point had to be stretched. The United States may be stretching the concept of pre-emptive self-defence if it uses that as an argument for intervening in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, but at least that doctrine exists, unlike the doctrine of humanitarian intervention. What we did in Kosovo was illegal.</p> <p pid=".838.0/4">A great many Labour Members and some Conservative Members seem to have problems with what the Government are doing now, when there is a strong case that the action is legal, even if the case is not watertight. In Kosovo, the action was clearly illegal. There were three major debates in the House on that action, and no one voted against it, even though they could have forced votes on the Adjournment. There was nothing like the plethora of activity that we are seeing now. One cannot help wondering what prejudices this policy on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has tickled.</p> <p pid=".838.0/5">The leader of the war party at the time of Kosovo, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - &#39;the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)&#39;">Mr. Cook</a>, who spoke yesterday—I told him that I would refer in this debate to what he said—is now apparently the leader of the peace party. At the time, he argued strongly for the intervention in Kosovo on what I consider were powerful and compelling moral grounds. There was indeed a strong moral case for intervening, but there was not a legal case for doing so. Are we now saying that Milosevic was a bigger threat to international peace and security than <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, or that Milosevic was committing worse breaches of human rights than Saddam Hussein? Milosevic did not have weapons of mass destruction; Saddam Hussein almost certainly did.</p> <p pid=".838.0/6">Those who wrap themselves in principle and say that on this occasion they are behaving out of principle, as the right hon. Gentleman does, at least owe us consistency. If people base their views on foreign policy on principle and morality and they are inconsistent, one is entitled to ask about their sincerity. Those who will oppose the Government tonight out of their principles cannot have been acting on the same principles when they supported the Government on Kosovo.</p></div>

If we do not think that it has changed for us, we must understand that it has changed for the United States. Things that were previously acceptable as nuisances or pinpricks no longer are. We must also accept that only the United States will sort out the problems. We will not do it; the French will not do it. If we and the French could talk to each other, we could not do it together. We are going to rely on the United States to do it.</p> <p pid=".839.3/3">The idea that our foreign policy can be carried out legally and morally only if it is the subject of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> resolution is a dreadful hostage to fortune. It gives any of the five permanent members of the Security Council a veto over what we decide to do.</p> <p pid=".839.3/4">On my second point, I turn to what will happen or not happen tonight. I have read the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> with more than 100 signatures against it. Presumably, rather more hon. Members will vote for it. The case could have been made until two or three weeks ago, but do those hon. Members really think that it is sensible, at this late stage in the day, to try to defeat the Government on the matter? Let us consider what the consequences would be if the Government were defeated.</p> <p pid=".839.3/5">If, on the verge of battle, with our troops and their command structure integrated into an alliance with the United States, playing vital small parts in that military effort, they were withdrawn, that would destroy the credibility of British foreign and security policy for a generation. Just reflect what happened at Suez. It took 26 years, till the Falklands war, for the credibility of British foreign policy to be reasserted. If we withdraw—</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".840.2/1"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_July">In July</a> last year the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> took the decision to work through the United Nations. He was the first person to call for UN weapons inspectors to be readmitted to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. France was not calling for that, nor was Germany, nor was the peace movement and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CND">CND</a>, nor was the United States, so it was a major achievement to gain unanimous support in November for resolution 1441.</p> <p pid=".840.2/2">I deeply regret the divisions on the Security Council that have opened up since then. Those divisions, as I said earlier, have had the effect of disarming the United Nations, rather than disarming <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-24">24 February</phrase> France, Germany and Russia submitted a memorandum to the Security Council that stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".840.2/3">"The unity of the Security Council must be preserved."</p> <p pid=".840.2/4">So why the talk of a veto? Why not negotiation with other members of the Security Council? Why not compromise on a defined period for disarmament to be followed by military action, as was proposed by our Government?</p> <p pid=".840.2/5">I wanted to see a second resolution carried in the Security Council before UK troops were committed to military action, but unfortunately the opportunity for that debate has been taken away by the French decision to wield its veto. I do not agree with the French or German view that if we give <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> a little more time, he will change his mind and disarm, but I respect the German position when they say that they will not participate in military action. I would respect the French position if they said the same, but I cannot accept that France, Russia or China have a right to use their veto to prevent others from enforcing UN resolutions.</p> <p pid=".840.2/6">In the absence of the second resolution that I wanted to see, I simply ask two questions. First, has Saddam complied and disarmed? The answer is no. Secondly, does it matter? As far as I am concerned, the answer is yes. Given that we, the Americans and others have built up forces in the region, we now face only two alternatives—to commit those troops in the very near future to military enforcement of the UN resolutions or to pull them out of the theatre. If we pull them out, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will immediately end what limited compliance it has shown with the UN's requirements. We cannot keep those forces on stand-by in tents in the desert and bobbing up and down in ships on Indian ocean for a further 120 days, as the French proposed. Every Member of this House knows that. Indeed, France knew that when it put forward its 120-day proposal.</p> <p pid=".840.2/7">I detest the prospect of war every bit as much as the many constituents who have written to me opposing it, but I do not believe that we can ignore the threat that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> poses to neighbouring states, the gross violation of the human rights of the Iraqi people or the risk that the Iraqi regime will at some point in future supply chemical or biological agents to terrorists who might use them in this country or elsewhere in Europe.</p> <p pid=".840.2/8">I am deeply concerned about the humanitarian consequences of war. There is an urgent need to ensure that responsibility for distributing food under the oil-for-food programme is transferred from the Iraqi authorities to the United Nations and that there is adequate funding to ensure that that happens, because 60 per cent. of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> population depends on that food aid. We need to ensure that neighbouring countries open their borders to refugees and that refugee camps have water, sanitation and health facilities. As my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1337" title="Our page on Tony Worthington - &#39;the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Tony Worthington)&#39;">Tony Worthington</a> said, we need to ensure that the UN runs the post-war reconstruction of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Without UN leadership, many donor countries simply will not make the contributions that will be necessary to rebuild <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".840.2/9">I am pleased that our Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has put Palestine on to the agenda. There cannot be peace in the middle east without the creation of a Palestinian state and security for the state of Israel. Members of this House cannot ignore the fact that security for the state of Israel will be impossible as long as Saddam in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is providing funding and support to the families of suicide bombers.</p> <p pid=".840.2/10">Finally, and importantly, I pay tribute to the almost 600 men and women of 2 Signal Regiment from my city, York, who are currently on active service in the Gulf. We in this House do not face the dangers that they face and we in this country are fortunate to have brave and professional soldiers in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a>, and our other servicemen and women. They are deeply respected for their professionalism throughout the world and my thoughts are with them now.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".841.0/1">Securing the approval of the United Nations has become the rallying cry for some who oppose military action in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. For them, no war without a second UN resolution has actually meant no war at all in any circumstances and whatever the provocation. That evasion is deliberate. However, the United Nations cannot absolve us from exercising our own critical or moral judgment. Although UN approval is useful in garnering international support, a democratic sovereign nation state has the right to defend itself from external aggression, even if the UN or its Security Council has not given its blessing.</p> <p pid=".841.0/2">The judgments that we must make today are whether our country is right to go to war, and, if so, whether it is necessary to go to war now. Anyone who, like me, has voluntarily joined Her Majesty's regular armed forces is unlikely to support the "no war ever" brigade. No one who believes that a major war would probably be initiated by a nation where power was concentrated in the hands of the evil, the insane or the bigoted dictator can be in any doubt that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> poses a potential threat.</p> <p pid=".841.0/3">I have no doubt that Europe owes its freedom, and that some of its people owe their very existence, to the people and Governments of the United States. We owe that great nation a debt that too many in Europe ignore. Despite all that, I believe that the case for a war now has not been made. Too little has been done to put irresistible pressure on Saddam Hussein to effect the changes that our safety demands.</p> <p pid=".841.0/4">Any threat has two components: the available weapons and the likelihood of their use. In the past, the Iraqi regime has manufactured chemical, biological and probably nerve agents. They are weapons not of war but of terror, of which Saddam Hussein must undoubtedly be deprived. However, the Government have not demonstrated that they are easily available for use now. Neither have they shown that, contrary to all Saddam's previous actions, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> intends to threaten us with their use. I asked the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-12">12 February</phrase></p> <p class="indent" pid=".841.0/5">"what new threat, proven threat or imminent threat is there to justify war?"—[<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pop=1&amp;s=date:20030212+column:860+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 12 February 2003; Vol. 399, c. 860</a>.]</p> <p pid=".841.0/6">The question remains unanswered.</p> <p pid=".841.0/7">We were first told that war was necessary as the Iraqi regime had a history of supporting al-Qaeda. Undoubtedly the regime has supported terrorism, and so have Syria, Iran and Libya. But al-Qaeda? Hardly. A godless, ruthless dictator with a history of oppressing his own Islamic people is inimical to such a fundamentalist terrorist organisation.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".843.1/1">I agree absolutely. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> should have done that. I intend to show why he would never do it.</p> <p pid=".843.1/2">Would the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> be better off if Saddam Hussein were dead or in exile? The answer is undoubtedly yes. Does the Iraqi regime have weapons of mass destruction? It almost certainly does. They are possibly so well hidden that they would be difficult to use immediately. Has Saddam Hussein supported terrorist organisations? Again, the answer is yes, but, as far as I am aware, to a lesser extent than Syria. None of those factors justifies immediate military action.</p> <p pid=".843.1/3">Much more could and should have been done to bring irresistible pressure to bear on Saddam Hussein by, for example, extending the no-fly zones to cover the whole of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, by requiring Iraqi military personnel and equipment to be returned to agreed positions or by demanding that the weapons inspectors had unfettered access to sites and Iraqi personnel. Such draconian measures might have received international approval, and might reluctantly have been accepted by Saddam Hussein, provided that the visible threat of war continued. They certainly would have degraded the Iraqi regime's ability to resist military action if it came. Obviously, I cannot prove that my ideas, or any others, would have worked. I believe, however, that much more could have been done, and that much more should have been done differently, so that the effect of prevarication or cheating would have been obvious. We did not do that, however. Instead, we made demands that the Iraqi regime was always unlikely to accept, and which, if it did pretend to accept them, would be easy to cheat or lie about, as its dishonesty was hard to prove.</p> <p pid=".843.1/4">So, we are faced with war. It is a war whose justification will not be accepted by most of the Muslim world. Too little fresh thinking has been employed in trying to avert it, and its rationale has changed as each reason has remained unproven. It is portrayed as a war of last resort, yet it appears to be born of frustration with a regime and a leader without whom the world would be better off. I will give my unswerving support to those whom we have sent to fight in our name, but I will not support a premature decision to wage war. I hope that we will not come to regret this, but I fear that we will.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".843.2/1">I would like to begin by paying tribute to my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - &#39;the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)&#39;">Mr. Cook</a>. When I was a Member of the European Parliament, I worked closely with him when he was <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> and Foreign Secretary, and I have a deep respect for his genuine internationalism.</p> <p pid=".843.2/2">Like many Members of the House, I have thought long and hard about this complex issue. I have great respect for everyone who has spoken in this debate and for the many people with whom I have had discussions on the issue over the last couple of weeks. I want to say clearly that I support the Government. I do so not out of any sycophancy or blind loyalty, but because I believe that the position that they have adopted is morally correct.</p> <p pid=".843.2/3">Equally, I would like to say that I am not naturally a great ally or fan of the United States of America. I remember going to Nicaragua on two occasions in the 1980s, and I saw at first hand the extremely negative aspects of the US foreign policy of the time for the people of that country. Furthermore, when I turn on the television and see <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W">George W</a>. Bush, I frequently cringe when I hear the vacuous rhetoric that he often employs. That is not a reason, however, to oppose the US position on <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. It is incumbent on all of us carefully to study precisely what the American position is, and what it means in practice.</p> <p pid=".843.2/4">Like many Members of the House, I had strongly hoped that we would have had a second United Nations resolution. However, having studied carefully the transcripts of various statements by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Chirac">President Chirac</a> of France, there is no doubt in my mind that the French are primarily responsible for the fact that we do not have such a resolution. They threatened to use their veto in a quite unreasonable way, and many of us who wanted a second resolution did so on the assumption that all parties on the Security Council would approach the issue in a constructive, objective and fair way. That clearly has not happened.</p> <p pid=".843.2/5">We have to ask ourselves why the French have adopted this position. Some people might cite French commercial and oil interests. We have to bear in mind, however, that the French are playing a longer and bigger game plan here. They are concerned, it would seem, with developing an alternative global vision to that of the United States. They see themselves as the new and natural leaders of the European Union. I find that perspective extremely worrying, and I think that we in our country must ensure that there is a bridge between the United States and Europe enabling us all to work together as far as is humanly possible.</p> <p pid=".843.2/6">We must also never forget that, time and again, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> has been given the opportunity to resolve the situation. The onus has rightly been placed on him. If he had said at any moment—not during the last few days or months, but at any time during the last 12 years—that he was prepared to comply with United Nations resolutions, we would not be in our present position. We should never, ever forget that.</p> <p pid=".843.2/7">A clear choice is before us today. Many have talked of the consequences of military action; let me briefly refer to some of the consequences that I envisage in the event of no military action. First, I believe that the UN's influence would be reduced still further. Our <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s approach has, I believe, been the right approach. We must ensure that once military action has been taken, the UN continues to play a major role in world affairs and, in particular, plays a leading role in the creation of the democratic <span class="hi">Iraq</span> that we want to see. If we abdicate our responsibilities, the chances of that will be significantly less. Secondly, I believe that if we vote against military action there will still be a war: there will be a war if the United States alone attacks <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. I think that that more than anything else would reinforce the inclination of many in the US Administration to go for unbridled unilateralism, which would constitute a huge step back for the global community. I fear, too, that the much-discussed road map would be that much more difficult to fulfil.</p> <p pid=".843.2/8">If the United States and we do not take action, however, Saddam Hussein will have been given the all-clear to keep his weapons of mass destruction. Moreover, he will have been given the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK">OK</a> by us to develop them still further. Let us not forget, too, that when we talk of weapons of mass destruction we talk of some of the most appalling weapons that humankind has developed—anthrax, mustard gas, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a> gas, sarin gas and so on.</p> <p pid=".843.2/9">Finally, let me say this. If we do not take action—if we abdicate our responsibilities—the consequences for the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will be dire. No one can doubt the barbarities of Saddam Hussein's regime: the torture, the persecution, the intimidation, the rape, the murder, the sheer inhumanity of the Ba'athist regime. My hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a> has depicted that inhumanity more graphically than anyone else I can think of. If we back down now, we will not be forgiven by thousands of ordinary people in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".843.2/10">Yesterday I was privileged to attend a meeting with the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Kurdish northern <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. The message was crystal clear: "Please stand by us. Please stand by the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, the Kurds and the Shi'ites, so that we can have a better life—a life free of tyranny and free of the tyranny of Saddam Hussein".</p> <p pid=".843.2/11">Like all other Members, I have given this issue careful consideration. I believe that there are powerful and genuine arguments on both sides; but I also believe that at this crucial time we must stand by the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, do what we believe is right, and support the Government's motion.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".845.0/1">As someone remarked earlier, there is a sense that this debate is a continuation of what we discussed at some length a few weeks ago. I dare say that we will come back to the subject in the next week or two.</p> <p pid=".845.0/2">Many arguments have been made and points touched on, but <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=715" title="Our page on John Baron - &#39;the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)&#39;">Mr. Baron</a> and <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=967" title="Our page on Douglas Hogg - &#39;the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)&#39;">Mr. Hogg</a> spoke of containment and deterrence as a way of dealing with the problem. Those concepts worked well during the cold war, but the world has changed since the cold war ended. We must recognise that containment and deterrence will not work in the situation that confronts us.</p> <p pid=".845.0/3">In the modern world, we face danger from what are called rogue states, terrorist groups and weapons of mass destruction. As a consequence of the cold war, there is a lot of expertise and matériel floating around the world that is not as well guarded as it should be. Perhaps we did not fully appreciate the problem before <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, but the events of that day should have concentrated minds on the matter. In the context of this debate, the significance of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> is that it made people realise that a different approach was needed if we were to deal with the problems caused by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD">WMD</a>, terrorist movements and rogue states.</p> <p pid=".845.0/4">That different approach was symbolised last year by the passing of resolution 1441. The international community decided to proceed by a route different from that offered by containment and deterrence, and to go back to the weapons inspections that had taken place immediately after the Gulf war. In that way, a serious effort was made to disarm <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>.</p> <p pid=".845.0/5">As I noted in the previous debate on the matter, there was a paradox in the attempt to disarm Saddam Hussein through weapons inspections. The paradox was that disarmament was not going to happen unless inspection was backed up by a credible threat of force. That was how it turned out: Saddam Hussein was not going to disarm voluntarily, and any moves made in that direction would happen only if he believed that massive force would be used against him if he did not comply.</p> <p pid=".845.0/6">The paradox was that the peaceful, diplomatic route was credible only if a major power was ready to use force, if necessary. However, that approach was no longer tenable after Monday of last week, when the French said that they would veto a resolution whatever the circumstances.</p> <p pid=".845.0/7">People have talked about the position of other countries, and about the position of Russia in particular. I shall talk about Russia again in a moment, but the French took a unique position because they said that they would veto any resolution that appeared to authorise force, whatever the circumstances. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French">The French</a> were not going to say, "Give it another month or couple of months." If the French position had been to give the approach a little more time, it would have been possible to maintain the credible threat of force. However, as soon as the French said that they would exercise their veto whatever the circumstances, they destroyed the credible threat of force used through the UN channel.</p> <p pid=".845.0/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> route was therefore blocked. The Government and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Government">US Government</a> spent a week seeing whether they could unblock it, or find some way around the blockage. I am surprised that they spent so long coming to terms with the French position, which effectively closed down the UN route.</p> <p pid=".845.0/9">Why have the French done this? Their actions are different from the normal French way of operating, with which we are all familiar. In the past, yes, the French have been awkward and difficult. They have hung on until people have met the requirements of what the French regard as their national interest, or until people have recognised the French position. They do not like being taken for granted, but in the past they have usually come into line.</p> <p pid=".845.0/10">There were indications that the Russians were going to do the same. Whatever their public position, the Russians had a shopping list. I am very glad that the Americans were not tempted to accede to the list, as the reports that I have heard suggest that it contained some pretty gruesome items. Be that as it may, the Russians were operating in their normal way, and one expected the French to do likewise. The question is, why did the French adopt the position of saying that they would exercise the veto, whatever the circumstances?</p> <p pid=".845.0/11"><a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=842" title="Our page on Wayne David - &#39;The hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David)&#39;">Mr. David</a> was getting close to the answer to that question when he said that it went back to the French view of themselves in Europe. The hon. Gentleman said that the French believe that they should lead Europe, and that Europe should be another pole of power in the world—a challenge or a rival to the US. However, they discovered that that was not the view of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of European countries. That goes a long way to explain the French position and I hope that the Government will bear that in mind when we come to the accession of the eastern European countries to the European Union. I hope that that will not be subject to a veto. We should also remember that point when we consider the outcome of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Future_of_Europe">Convention on the Future of Europe</a>.</p> <p pid=".845.0/12">For present purposes, we must recognise that the UN route ended on Monday last week. What do we do now? We are not where we wanted to be and the situation is not ideal, but we must operate in the circumstances that now prevail. Are we just going to strike camp and go away? Will the United States allow itself to be humiliated by the French? No, it will not, and nor could anyone reasonably expect that. Nor would it be reasonable to think along those lines ourselves. If resolution 1441 is right, ensuring compliance with it is also right. The French action, therefore, is an unreasonable exercise of the veto.</p> <p pid=".845.0/13">The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> made a powerful and compelling speech. I agreed especially with the comments that he made towards the end of it. We must make a choice in the present circumstances. We must consider the consequences of that choice, some of which are unknowable and unpredictable. There is an element of risk in the choice that we make, but we must make it. The situation is imperfect—this is an imperfect world—and the issue cannot be easily compartmentalised. In the present situation, however, we do not have much of a choice and that is why my colleagues and I will support the Government in the Lobby tonight.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".847.0/1">I am pleased to follow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1289" title="Our page on David Trimble - &#39;the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble)&#39;">Mr. Trimble</a>, because, as leader of his party, alongside the other party leaders in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, he has shown the way in going the extra mile when the point is reached at which they are as frustrated with the peace process as any <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> is with the present international impasse. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned from that.</p> <p pid=".847.0/2">The imagery of the past few weeks has included some disturbing contrasts. We have seen 1.5 million people on the streets of London—one of the biggest demonstrations ever. We have seen the images of the Iraqis sending old al-Samoud missiles off to the knacker's yard and the awesome sight of an army of modern weaponry on the border of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, prepared to invade and occupy a small but strategic and historic country in the middle east. There is always something distasteful and unpleasant about overweening might being used in war against a much smaller nation. It is the imagery of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_and_Goliath">David and Goliath</a>, the bully in the playground, the Soviet invasion of Hungary or the tanks rolling into Czechoslovakia, the bombing of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Moneda">La Moneda</a> palace in Chile in 1973 and, indeed, the despotic acts of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> in oppressing minorities in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".847.0/3">I disagreed with my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> today when he compared this situation with that in 1938. In that situation, we faced a country that itself was using overweening force to impose its will on other smaller countries. It was right to challenge the US Administration and go through the UN last autumn, but it became apparent that that approach could be interpreted in two ways. The danger was that the US would see the UN approach as a vindication of something that it always intended to do and would pay only lip service to resolution 1441. On the other hand, resolution 1441 could be seen as the consensus between those nations—I count Britain among them—that genuinely felt that it offered the potential of disarmament without military action.</p> <p pid=".847.0/4">The effectiveness of the peaceful approach was undermined every time that we saw <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> or other members of the US Administration on television saying, "We will take military action to enforce our will in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, but we would prefer a UN resolution." It was undermined every time that Britain failed to offer a strong rebuttal of such statements or to demand publicly that the US should declare that it was prepared not to use military force if that was the consensus reached in the UN. It was undermined whenever <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> said that the UN mandate would not prevail and that nothing would stop the US. It was undermined when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France">President of France</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a>, threatened recently to veto rather than negotiate the terms of a second resolution, which we all wanted desperately to see negotiated in the Security Council.</p> <p pid=".847.0/5">Resolution 1441 required that the Security Council consider the outcome of the weapons inspections and it clearly left the UN in control of whether action was taken. Our Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> understood that very well, and I applaud their efforts. The collective view has not been secured, however, and that imposes constraints on everyone, whether they comply or not. As matters stand, we are no longer in compliance with the international will and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> has not lent his authority to military action.</p> <p pid=".847.0/6">When I was in Africa last week I was struck by the shock and incredulity of people in the small country of Malawi at the British position. They said, "But we thought that Britain was on our side. We thought that you would support small, developing countries that have only international bodies to protect them." Only six months ago, a large group of young constituents came here on the fair trade lobby, feeling totally in tune with a Government who had a proud record of tough international action on the issue. That has been a hallmark of this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> and we have been in tune with the new generation, reflecting their growing recognition that the world is now a smaller place and that we are now more dependent than ever on a collective approach not only to security, but to the joint occupation of this planet.</p> <p pid=".847.0/7">Two weeks ago, I supported the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that considered that war was not yet inevitable. The decision and judgment for MPs is more difficult today, because further efforts have been made and there is a serious question about where we should go from here. First, we are all united in supporting the troops. Secondly, we hope that the new smart bombs that are supposed to be able to destroy everything within 600 yd will try not to destroy too many people. Thirdly, we hope that the excellent section of the Government motion—if it is passed tonight—on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_Palestine">Israel and Palestine</a> will be realised.</p> <p pid=".847.0/8">I remain sceptical about any war that is said to end wars; I remain sceptical that this war will secure defence against international terrorism; and I remain sceptical, finally, that this will reap—</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".849.1/1">Our difficulties in this debate are as nothing to those that confront our armed forces, who deserve our unqualified support. It has been a principled decision of my party to uphold international order and institutions—in particular, the United Nations. We have consistently argued, first, that military action should not take place to enforce resolution 1441 without a mandate from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, and, secondly, that no British forces should be committed to any military action without a debate in the House and a substantive vote in favour. I personally have engrafted a further condition to my constituents—I would in no circumstances do anything that I consider would undermine our armed forces.</p> <p pid=".849.1/2">I am grateful to the Government for—uniquely, I believe—providing an opportunity for this debate and vote. The whole country is well aware of the lengths to which the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> and his team have gone to secure the further resolution from the United Nations to authorise military action. There has, however, been a failure of diplomacy. Considerable criticism has been directed at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Administration">United States Administration</a> for adopting a bulldozer approach and displaying a cavalier insensitivity towards a number of our allies and a number of their potential, and crucial, allies. However, I support our strong links with the United States. Despite one or two hiccups, for the past century our close links with the United States have served both countries well.</p> <p pid=".849.1/3">The position of France has always been pivotal to the negotiations on a further resolution of the United Nations. It is deeply disappointing that France's final position was that, whatever further resolution was passed, it would veto any measure that provided authority for the use of military force in the event of failure. France's position was pivotal: if she had been prepared to vote for a resolution, not to vote at all, or not to veto a resolution, I believe that it would have caused a domino effect and that the resolution would have passed. Whatever criticisms can be directed at the allies, France does not come to this matter with clean hands. France has her own view of the world and the French have major contingent contracts and commercial interests with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".849.1/4">The Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has not spared himself in endeavouring to secure a second resolution, which demonstrates the importance that he and his Government attach to that second resolution. It would have been crucial to my party's support for any military <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. The courageous men and women of our armed forces are now about to be sent into battle. They simply cannot be kept hanging around any longer. I offer them my wholehearted support. In the terms of the main <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, I express my</p> <p class="indent" pid=".849.1/5">"admiration for their courage, skill and devotion to duty".</p> <p pid=".849.1/6">I not only hope but believe that their tasks will be swiftly concluded with minimal casualties on all sides.</p> <p pid=".849.1/7">I cannot vote against a motion that offers support to Her Majesty's armed forces who are now on duty in the middle east. Of course, there are matters in the Government motion with which I do not agree and which I cannot support. Nevertheless, there is much in the Government motion with which I do agree and which I can support. I shall, however, vote for the main amendment. I concede that it took the imminent threat of overwhelming force, but the weapons inspectors were having significant success. I strongly believe in world order, the reverse of which is anarchy and chaos.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".850.2/1">There is an old and famous observation about the relationship between murder and international power politics: if someone murders one person, they go to prison for life; if someone murders 15 people, they are put in a sanatorium; and if someone murders 150,000 people, they get invited to a peace conference. Those words were much in my mind yesterday when I listened to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> talking about the prospect of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> resigning power voluntarily. The Foreign Secretary said that Saddam Hussein would be offered and would receive amnesty and indemnity internationally for the crimes that he had committed.</p> <p pid=".850.2/2">In these debates in the House, there has been no shortage of people who have set out in graphic detail the crimes and the iniquities that Saddam Hussein has committed against his own and other people; the individual and collective tortures that he has visited on those people; and the gassing, the burning and the mutilations for which he has been responsible. If that indemnity is to take place, those who have suffered those injustices will have no justice.</p> <p pid=".850.2/3">Whether there is a greater right or greater wrong in offering such indemnity is not the reason behind my observations, but I wish to reflect on these questions. By whose authority is that indemnity offered? Whose writ runs here and whose may be abrogated? On what authority would that be done? Who decides which mass murderers should be the subject of indemnity and pardon, and which should be the subject of indictment? Who decides which mass murderers should be the subject of condemnation and which should be hanged? Who decides that Milosevic should be in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague">The Hague</a>, as he undoubtedly should be for his complicity in the murder of thousands in Bosnia? Who decides that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> should be supreme in Israel, which he undoubtedly should not be because of his complicity in the murders at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila">Sabra and Shatila</a>? Who decides that Hamas is a terrorist organisation, which it undoubtedly is, and that the Contras were a freedom-fighting organisation, which they undoubtedly were not? Who decides that the hundreds who are held without trial or civil rights in Zimbabwe present an affront to international justice? Who decides that it is necessary for international security to hold hundreds in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_X-Ray">Camp X-Ray</a> in Guantanamo bay in Cuba, which undoubtedly it is not?</p> <p pid=".850.2/4">Who decides on the form of international justice that the Foreign Secretary talked about? The Foreign Secretary, of course, was echoing and acting as a mouthpiece for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, who has already set it out.</p> <p pid=".850.2/5">I can say straight away that it is not the UN that decides such matters. When one reads resolution 1441, one finds, despite its inordinate length and impenetrable prose, absolutely nothing that speaks of any form of clemency for, or acquittal of, Saddam Hussein.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".851.1/1">That is not the position that I advocate, as the hon. Gentleman will realise if he listens for a while. My point is this: who creates this form of international justice? I am not arguing about its merits, but pointing out that the perception that concerns this House and creates aversion outside it is that this international power is wielded not by the United Nations, nor even by the United States, but by the Bush Administration from within the United States. What concerns my constituents and those throughout the country and the world is the prospect of the uncontrolled, unbridled power now exercised by America, as America chooses and America pleases. My constituents perceive, although they would not put in these terms, that we now have a de facto international monarchy—an autocracy that rules by its own version of divine right. The genesis of that divine right can be found in its charter—the project for a new American century.</p> <p pid=".851.1/2">Much has been said today about America. As I have said before, America is the greatest paradox in the world. There is no greater force for peace in my lifetime than America, and I have never known a greater cause for war. No country holds a torch for freedom that burns as brightly as that of America, and in my lifetime no country has so often been vilified—on many occasions, rightly—for the perception that it denies those freedoms to others, as it has on many occasions, notably in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America">Latin America</a>. That is the great paradox.</p> <p pid=".851.1/3">What matters about America is who governs it and what is done in its name. We are now in a black period of American history, and that fact is perceived darkly by our constituents. That is why, sometimes apparently incomprehensibly, they oppose the overthrowing of a dictator because they believe that the method is unacceptable.</p> <p pid=".851.1/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American">The American</a> Administration wish to overthrow <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. That was set out in the project for a new American century even before <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush">George Bush</a> obtained the power that he has in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House">White House</a>. They will do it by whatever means that they can, and that is also known to those who observe, but they will not do it by war: it will be done by slaughter. It will be done by the means that we saw exercised on the Basra road and the Mitla ridge, when <i>Newsweek</i> reported that American soldiers, white-faced and vomiting, were standing underneath bridges ankle-deep in Iraqi blood and saying, "Jesus, did we do that?" That is the prospect that we face in the coming days. Of course it will be short: no such slaughter could be anything else.</p> <p pid=".851.1/5">I long—I really do—for a time when we have an international system that means that we no longer have to walk by and listen to the screams in our neighbour's house, and when the duty to intervene in Rwanda and in Bosnia will be undertaken by the international community, not taken by anybody as a capricious right. That day, which I long for both as a lawyer and as a politician, will not be brought a second, a minute or an hour closer by the exercise of arbitrary and capricious power.</p></div>

Members may recall that he said that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had made most of them itself.</p> <p pid=".852.0/3">I would suggest that there is abundantly clear evidence that, instead of taking a high-handed and upmarket view of ourselves, we should accept a considerable measure of the responsibility for what has happened. Now that our sittings finish at 7 o'clock, I am engaging in reading books, which is something that I have not done for a long time. If any hon. Member wants to know about the subject, they should buy a book called "The Death Lobby: How the West Armed <span class="hi">Iraq</span>", by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Timmerman">Kenneth Timmerman</a>. It is a rather dramatic book that gives full details of where all the materials came from, and we simply have to accept some responsibility for that.</p> <p pid=".852.0/4">What kinds of materials are we talking about? I have managed to get full details not only of the materials that were sent, but when they were sent—on which days—from the United States to <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> and Government. It is an astonishing list. It includes bacillus anthracis, which is just anthrax—a very substantial amount; clostridium, which is the source of a toxin; histoplasma, which causes a disease resembling tuberculosis; brucella, which damages major organs; another material that causes gas gangrene; E. coli; and seven others. Those materials were not produced by <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, but provided and sold by the western powers. We should show a little humility and decency, and say that part of the problem came from ourselves.</p></div>

I am simply saying that, in arguing that here is a bad state doing evil things, we should remember that lots of other countries—including the United States, Russia and France—were involved in providing such material. It would be very wrong indeed not to accept some degree of responsibility.</p> <p pid=".853.3/2">My second point concerns our responsibilities in international law. The Government's biological <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=221" title="A Green Paper is a tentative report of British government proposals without..." class="glossary">Green Paper</a> states that there was an "internationally legally binding instrument", and that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".853.3/3">"those at every level responsible for any breach of international law will be held personally accountable."</p> <p pid=".853.3/4">That refers to the export of biological and toxic materials. The danger is that we are throwing away a great deal, and that, to some degree, we might be responsible for such matters. It is totally wrong to say that some people in the world are good and some are bad, because we have a great deal of responsibility for them.</p> <p pid=".853.3/5">There is a great feeling among us that we are going to intervene, improve matters and restore democracy, freedom and liberty, but where is the evidence that such <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> has been successful in the past? For example, a great deal has been said about Afghanistan, a country that I know a little about, but can we say that things there are much better as a result of the intervention that took place? Rather, it is a pathetic country, run by a group of people who have no democratic responsibility whatever.</p></div>

As we well know, the production of materials that run rife in that country—drugs—has increased dramatically.

However, as I said, there is a danger in not accepting our responsibility. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations">The United Nations</a> has a very important role to play, but we must ask ourselves honestly whether we are using that facility in the proper way. For example, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Chile">Government of Chile</a>—an unusual little country—proposed that three weeks be allowed before <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. Of course, they were told that that was not even a consideration.</p> <p pid=".854.1/3">At the end of the day, we will regret it if we destroy the United Nations. I shall in no sense go against France, as some of my colleagues have done. They have voted to hand over most of our national sovereignty to such countries, and they seem now to regard France as a great enemy. I regard no country in that way. We need to show a little humility, and not think that we can provide the answer to everything by running the world and becoming the emperors of it. If we can show such humility, this will be a better debate, and there will be a better outcome for all concerned.</p></div>

Like every other Member, I have agonised over whether I could be party to a decision that will result in the death of innocent people, because that, inevitably, is what war involves.

However, the day has come, and we have to make a decision.</p> <p pid=".854.2/2">For us tonight, there is nowhere to hide. We will have to be honest with our constituents and, first of all, we have to be honest with ourselves. That is infinitely difficult if we cannot be certain that the decision that we take, individually or collectively, will be right; and it is all the more difficult when there is no unanimity on which is the right course.</p> <p pid=".854.2/3">I believe in just wars. I believe that they are commissioned in defence of freedom, and against oppression. I also believe that, for them to be just wars, they must be the last resort. Diplomacy must come first, but if we are ultimately to prevail in defence of what we believe to be right, there must also be a limit to diplomacy.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".855.1/1">My hon. Friend makes precisely the point that I was trying to make, but far more eloquently. We do not have the gift of hindsight, and we will not have it for many years. Nevertheless, tonight we must make a principled and rational decision.</p> <p pid=".855.1/2">Like other Members, I believe in the United Nations, for all its imperfections and deficiencies, and for all its sins and omissions. It is the best hope that we have, and it provides the best opportunity to build international consensus, and to impose and sustain a world order that believes in the same principles that we hold dear. I wish that the United Nations had been more consistent, and that we, too, had been more consistent. When we intervened in Kosovo without a UN mandate, I said that I hoped that this was the beginning of a new world order. I hoped that we would be emboldened to intervene, when required, before genocide was committed in Rwanda, rather than wringing our hands afterwards. Had we been more consistent, perhaps we would be facing less difficulty now over the legitimacy of intervening in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. If we do intervene, as seems inevitable, I hope that we will in future take to heart the lessons about consistency, and that we will be prepared, together as an international community, to intervene to prevent genocide and oppression, and to deter dictators.</p> <p pid=".855.1/3">For the past six months, I have characterised my views on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> as being open-minded but sceptical: that I could be persuaded that this would be a just war, but that I had yet to be so persuaded. I was looking for the killer fact. We all acknowledge that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction, and we know that he has used them brutally against his own people and against others. However, we, too, have weapons of mass destruction. The key point is: is he prepared to use them again? If he is—if we have that intelligence—the case for war is unanswerable. However, we have not had that killer fact.</p> <p pid=".855.1/4">In listening to the debate that took place in this Chamber three weeks ago, I had sympathy with the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> tabled by my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1232" title="Our page on Chris Smith - &#39;the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith)&#39;">Mr. Smith</a>. He said that the case had not been made. He and his colleagues argued that we needed a second UN resolution desperately—in fact, it would have been the 18th resolution—because wars are always evil, and innocent people get killed in wars. They argued that without a second resolution, we would light the blue touch paper to a conflagration in the middle east and recruit people to terrorism, but that if we got that resolution and Saddam still failed to come to order, undertaking military <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> would be justified. However, would innocent people still not die in those circumstances? Would we still not risk a conflagration in the middle east? Would we still not recruit people to terrorist causes? Wars do that, with or without resolutions.</p> <p pid=".855.1/5">I say to my colleagues that convictions are not enough; we also need courage and clear-sightedness to see the world not as we would like to see it, but as it is—as Saddam has made it. For 30 years he has oppressed his people and butchered Iraqi minorities; he has invaded his neighbours and threatened us all with weapons of mass destruction and for 30 years, yes, we have tolerated it. Some western nations supplied and fuelled his ambitions and his barbarity. We should indeed be humble, as <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1276" title="Our page on Teddy Taylor - &#39;the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor)&#39;">Sir Teddy Taylor</a> suggested, but that does not mean that we should do nothing.</p> <p pid=".855.1/6">Last November, it appeared that the United Nations had woken up to its responsibilities. There was unanimous support for resolution 1441, which spoke of final opportunities and serious consequences. Four months later, when Saddam has failed to comply with that resolution, the international community has shown that it is not serious about "serious consequences".</p> <p pid=".855.1/7">I was prepared to support the drive for a second resolution, not because I felt that we needed its legitimacy, but because the decision before us would have been much more straightforward if the international community had been united and also because public opinion demanded it. However, as colleagues have suggested, the French put that diplomacy beyond reach; their President foreclosed on diplomacy.</p> <p pid=".855.1/8">A stark choice faces us: we can walk away from our international responsibilities and our obligations to the Iraqis and cede victory to Saddam and to every fascist dictator who chooses to emulate him; we can decide not to decide; or we can take the decision that no one who loves peace chooses to make or ever thought that they would have to make—to fulfil our obligations and go to war to secure peace.</p> <p pid=".855.1/9">Do those who say no to war in their name want Saddam to continue his barbarity in their name? Are we to abandon his victims in their name? Just as they warn us of the consequences of the war that we may commit, it is right to warn them of the consequences of inaction. I share the misgivings expressed by right hon. and hon. Members about United States policy and about US contempt for the UN, which is in stark contrast to the commitment and consistent principles that we have adopted in pursuit of diplomacy; but if might is not always right, being strong is not always wrong either. Whether we like it or not, we have to accept that the US is the only global superpower. We can either try to influence it within the international community or abandon the world to its often cynical self-interest.</p> <p pid=".855.1/10">Now is decision time. If we are to set aside our prejudices and accept that doing nothing is not an option, if we accept that diplomacy is at an end and that Saddam continues to defy and threaten us, what is the alternative to war? It is not the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s war. It is not the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_President">American President</a>'s war—it is Saddam's war. We must join it and end it as soon as possible.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".857.0/1">I am no peacenik. I supported action in the Falklands and the Gulf. I supported the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s excursions in Kosovo. When the Serbian army withdrew, its condition was such that I was glad that Milosevic had decided not to fight. If he had, the outcome could have been much more bloody and horrific.</p> <p pid=".857.0/2">If there is a war, I, like everyone in the House, will give our troops full support. The Iraqi regime is rotten and the war could be short, so we shall be in the reconstruction and rebuilding phase quicker than we might anticipate. I wonder whether the Government have spent enough time looking at reconstruction, rather than knocking things down.</p> <p pid=".857.0/3">I made it clear that unless there was a second resolution I would not support the Government. I shall vote for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, but I shall do so with reluctance and regret; in 26 years as a Member of the House, this will only be the second or third time that I have voted against my party.</p> <p pid=".857.0/4">There are additional reasons for my views. The proposed action will crack unity—if it has not cracked already—in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>, the EU, the Security Council and the United Nations. I am not saying that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpty_Dumpty">Humpty Dumpty</a> can never be put together again, but it will take a long, long time. I take no pride in hearing clever-clever remarks knocking other countries, because sooner or later we shall have to get together and rebuild things. We shall have to bring about international agreement on the way forward. Smart remarks against the French and remarks such as those made by the American <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> are not helpful and I greatly regret that they were made.</p> <p pid=".857.0/5">The Government produced various arguments that were apparently the best thing to do at the time, which seems to be part of their policy. They have proposed the morality argument. I go along with that. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> is an evil man. I am one of the few Members who have actually met him. If he were to be found dead tomorrow, I would not lose sleep. But where do we stop? It is Saddam Hussein today because he is an evil, wicked man, but who will it be tomorrow? I would have more respect for the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> if they had condemned what was happening in Rwanda at the time and said that we should put forces into that country to stop the terrible genocide. The standard punishment for young girls at that time was to take off their hands at the wrist.</p> <p pid=".857.0/6">Where will the moral argument take us? I am concerned that the Americans will become the international peacekeepers; they will be <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillon">Matt Dillon</a> while we are Chester, limping along behind. We must think carefully when we take the path of ending tyrannical regimes.</p> <p pid=".857.0/7">To try to bolster their case, the Government produced documentation, rightly described as dodgy documents. To lift vast chunks of a person's work, which was already several years old, lard it with words such as "terrorism" and try to pass it off as one's own work is less than satisfactory.</p> <p pid=".857.0/8">Another argument is that Saddam attacked other countries. He fought Iran and Kuwait. However, as my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1276" title="Our page on Teddy Taylor - &#39;the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor)&#39;">Sir Teddy Taylor</a> pointed out, several western countries do not have entirely clean hands in that matter; we seem to pick and choose our support or condemnation of various people. The world should be careful about providing equipment and weapons of mass destruction to people of the ilk of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p pid=".857.0/9">We are told that Saddam Hussein still has weapons of mass destruction, but what will happen if we do not find them when we go in? If I were Saddam Hussein, I would have got rid of them long ago. We could be creating justification for every extremist Islamic group in the world to declare open season on the United Kingdom and the United States.</p></div>

I am greatly concerned that we have not spent enough time considering how to rebuild <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Have the Government thought the process through? What exactly will we put in place? I have heard about territorial protection and the maintenance of borders, but has anyone talked to the Kurds of northern <span class="hi">Iraq</span> about that? [Hon.

Have they signed up to all this?</p> <p pid=".858.1/3">In conclusion, I have to say that, without world support, I fear that our well-established moral integrity and authority throughout the world will be damaged and that Islamic extremists will take advantage of that if weapons of mass destruction are not found in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p></div>
