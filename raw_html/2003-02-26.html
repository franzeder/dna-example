It is not an endorsement of military action by United Kingdom forces. No decision to deploy British forces in action has yet been taken. As my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> spelled out a few moments ago, we will put any decision on military action to the House, and the timing will be subject only to the usual caveats about the safety of our forces. It is as much in the Government's interest as it is in the paramount interest of the House that we should do that before the start of any hostilities. In addition, there will be oral statements to the House on the business of the Security Council, and a full opportunity to debate and vote on the outcome of proceedings on any second resolution.</p> <p pid=".265.2/4">Let me commend to the House the Command Paper "<span class="hi">Iraq</span>", which I presented yesterday. For the convenience of the House, this contains in one document the reports of Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei, statements on the <span class="hi">Iraq</span> crisis by the European Union and by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>, my statements at three recent Security Council meetings, and, above all, the full texts of 13 of the principal Security Council resolutions on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> passed since August 1990.</p> <p pid=".265.2/5">The situation that we face is plainly grave. It is a matter that, across a range of beliefs, arouses great concern and anxiety. So in this debate I want to answer what I think are the central and continuing questions in people's minds. Why <span class="hi">Iraq</span>? Why now? Why not more time, more inspectors? Why a second resolution? Why not persist with the policy of containment, rather than contemplate military action? And finally, is not the west guilty of double standards, especially in relation to Israel/Palestine?</p> <p pid=".265.2/6">Let me deal with those questions in turn. First, why <span class="hi">Iraq</span>? The best answer to that question is to be found in the 42 pages of text of the 13 Security Council resolutions that form the first section of the Command Paper. There we see, paragraph by paragraph, the exceptional danger posed by <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, and its continued defiance of the United Nations. On <phrase class="date" code="1990-08-02">2 August 1990</phrase>, resolution 660 tells <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to withdraw from Kuwait. On <phrase class="date" code="1990-11-29">29 November 1990</phrase>, resolution 678 offers <span class="hi">Iraq</span> a "final opportunity"—interesting words—to comply, which it fails to take. On <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-03"><span class="hi">3</span> April 1991</phrase>, resolution 687 gives <span class="hi">Iraq</span> until <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-18">18 April 1991</phrase> to make a full declaration of the "locations, amount and types" of all chemical and biological weapons and of all medium and long-range ballistic missiles. That resolution bars <span class="hi">Iraq</span> from ever developing biological, chemical or nuclear weapons.</p> <p pid=".265.2/7">On and on the resolutions go. Resolution 688 is "gravely concerned" about the repression of the civilian population in many parts of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. In 1994, resolution 949</p> <p class="indent" pid=".265.2/8">"condemns military deployments by <span class="hi">Iraq</span> in the direction of the border with Kuwait", three years after the original invasion. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_1999">In 1999</a>, nine years after the invasion of Kuwait, resolution 1284 establishes a further inspection regime</p> <p class="indent" pid=".265.2/10">"as a result of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> failure to implement the Security Council Resolutions fully".</p> <p pid=".265.2/11"><span class="hi">Iraq</span> flatly and completely refuses to comply.</p> <p pid=".265.2/12">Last November, resolution 1441 recognised</p> <p class="indent" pid=".265.2/13">"the threat which <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> non-compliance with Council Resolutions and proliferation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Mass_Destruction">Weapons of Mass Destruction</a> and long range missiles poses to international peace and security"— and gave <span class="hi">Iraq</span> its "final opportunity to comply".</p> <p pid=".265.2/15">So, for the United Nations, the answer to the "Why <span class="hi">Iraq</span>?" question is very clear. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is the only country in such serious and multiple breach of mandatory UN obligations. It is the only country in the world to have fired missiles at five of its neighbours, the only country in history to have used chemical weapons against its own people, and the only country in the region that has invaded two of its neighbours in recent years.</p></div>

All the resolutions of the Security Council, 12 years of them, also help us answer that question.</p> <p pid=".267.2/3">Saddam's aim is that "now" shall never arrive. His tactics all along have been to prevaricate in the hope that by exploiting people's natural anxieties about military action he can string out the process for ever and keep his arsenal for good.</p> <p pid=".267.2/4">Let us look at the recent evidence. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-10">10 September</phrase> last year, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> declared—I was there in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly">General Assembly</a> when this was said—that it would never, ever readmit weapons inspectors under any circumstances. Then <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> made his important and most welcome speech to the General Assembly. Four days later, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> said that it would after all readmit weapons inspectors, but made its offer subject to 19 spurious conditions of the kind that it has often come forward with. Fortunately, those were rejected.</p> <p pid=".267.2/5">There were then two months of intense negotiations inside the Security Council. In response, the international community united, resolution 1441 was passed unanimously and the Security Council agreed to back its diplomacy with the credible threat of force. The inspectors finally entered <span class="hi">Iraq</span> on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-27">27 November</phrase>, looking, as the resolution required, for full, active and immediate co-operation from <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".267.2/6">But since the inspectors' return the story has been all too familiar. We saw first a 12,000-page Iraqi declaration, which Dr. Blix called</p> <p class="indent" pid=".267.2/7">"rich in volume but poor in new information . . . and practically devoid of new evidence."</p> <p pid=".267.2/8">There have been concerted Iraqi efforts to prevent unrestricted interviews with scientists. The issue of interviews with the scientists is not a trivial matter. It is the most important way in which we can arrive at the truth of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> chemical and biological weapons programmes.</p> <p pid=".267.2/9"><span class="hi">Iraq</span> refused any interviews to begin with. Since the weapons inspectors pressed the Iraqis, there have been three private interviews, all within the closing days up to Dr. Blix's report on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-14">14 February</phrase>, and, despite what we see in some newspapers about increased co-operation by the Iraqis, not one interview has been granted since. Time after time after time the Iraqis seek to impose conditions that make free and fair interviews almost impossible.</p></div>

Normally the complaint is that we have not had a debate soon enough. I plead guilty to the fact that we have not delayed this debate. We are having it today because we thought it entirely appropriate, given that we have submitted a draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council. As I made clear in my opening remarks, once there is a conclusion to the Security Council proceedings—and it may well be before that, too—we shall have a further debate and a vote in the House.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".269.1/1">I know that many hon. Members wish to take part in the debate, so the House will have to excuse me if I do not <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a>.</p> <p pid=".269.1/2">The next question that I raised was about more time and more inspections. I understand why there are calls for more time and more inspections, but Saddam has not shown that he is ready to break with the past. That is exactly what Dr. Blix said today. At present, it is not even clear whether the Iraqis really want to co-operate. In these circumstances, in the absence of active and immediate Iraqi co-operation, more time will not achieve anything of substance. Nor, without that active co-operation, can it be a question of more inspectors.</p> <p pid=".269.1/3">It took just nine inspectors to verify the disarmament of South Africa's nuclear weapons programme at the end of apartheid. It did not take 12 years. It did not take hundreds of inspectors. It did not take endless Security Council resolutions. It took three years, nine inspectors and no resolutions. Why? Because South Africa was complying with the inspectors.</p> <p pid=".269.1/4">It is critical that, in respect of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, we all accept one reality above all, which is that what grudging concessions on process there have been from Saddam have been secured only because of the military build-up. What is the difference between the circumstances now and the circumstances when resolution 1284 was agreed at the end of 1999, the resolution that set up the organisation of weapons inspectors, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a>? There is some difference in terms of the powers of the weapons inspectors. But the only significant, material difference is that, back at the end of 1999, the world said, "Let us try giving them more time. Let us try by a completely peaceful route to secure the disarmament of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Let us plead with the Iraqis to do the decent thing. Let us impose some sanctions, too, and hope that they will work."</p> <p pid=".269.1/5">Saddam's answer was to slam the door in the face of the international community. The only reason for the difference between Saddam's refusal to co-operate with one dot or comma in resolution 1284 and his very reluctant co-operation on some process today, his statement that he will co-operate, is the build-up of the credible threat of force, something clearly recognised by the United Nations charter.</p> <p pid=".269.1/6">I was glad to note that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Chirac">President Chirac</a> of France—and I pay tribute to him—conceded in an interview last week in <i>Time</i> magazine that it was the military build-up that had made the difference. There is a logic that follows—</p></div>

Indeed, I could not have been more accurate. I wanted then to spell out to the House what "serious consequences" meant. I wanted to tell the House without any dubiety that in voting to support resolution 1441, which we did by a huge <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a>, we were voting to recognise the serious consequences that would flow from a further material breach by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, up to and including the use of force.</p> <p pid=".270.1/2">I repeat for my hon. Friend what I said at the beginning of this debate. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations">The United Nations</a> is responsible for its resolutions, but the House as a whole is responsible for the motions that it passes. Notwithstanding my hon. Friend's invitation that we should seek a mandate for military action, we are not seeking one today because the Government have not yet got to that point. If we do reach that point, we will come back and seek a vote, through a debate in this House, on a substantive motion.</p></div>

Resolution 1441 required <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> full, active and immediate compliance, as indeed did resolution 687, which was passed 12 years ago. Fifteen weeks after 1441, Saddam's response has been neither full, nor active, nor immediate. He has not complied, and not a single member of the Security Council says otherwise. In place of active voluntary co-operation, we have had a string of cynically timed concessions that are calculated to divide and to delay.</p> <p pid=".270.3/3">We saw more token concessions last night. According to the newspapers, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has now told Dr. Blix that it has—and I quote—"found" a bomb. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has found a bomb containing biological agents—it simply popped up from some gooseberry bush. Some will be tempted to regard this as evidence that Saddam is being successfully contained, and that the inspectors should be given endless time. However, this latest "find" is the same old game of dribbling out small concessions at the last minute.</p></div>

Unless we bring this game to a halt, it will go on for as long as Saddam wants. I will not be surprised if, by the end of the week, Saddam is offering concessions on the proscribed al-Samoud missiles—having said that he will never destroy a single one—in the hope, once again, of playing for time. However, if the words "final opportunity", in operative paragraph 2 of resolution 1441, have any meaning, it is that this time we must not let Saddam lure the international community into endless indecision. Resolution 1441 called for disarmament "immediately". We have waited 110 days already, which is stretching the meaning of "immediately" to breaking point.</p> <p pid=".271.12/2">I ask our friends in France and Germany—who share our goal of Iraqi disarmament, and who fully support resolution 1441—why Saddam is more likely to co-operate actively, fully and immediately in the further 120 days that they now propose than he was in the past 110. What does he need 120 days for: to have a look for the weapons that he says he has not got, in case he has overlooked something; to search the homes of scientists for the incriminating papers that he ordered them to hide there; to tell those scientists to attend interviews and tell the truth that, through intimidation, he has instructed them to conceal?</p></div>

Why not persist with the policy of containment, rather than contemplate military action? After all, some argue that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has not invaded any of its neighbours or used chemical and biological weapons in the past 12 years, and that these weapons have either been destroyed, or do not present a sufficient threat to <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> neighbours or to the wider world to justify the use of force to remove them if Saddam refuses to do so peacefully.</p> <p pid=".273.1/3">I understand the containment argument, even if I do not agree with it. However, let no one be under any illusions: the policy of containment is not the policy of disarmament as set out in resolution 1441 or any of the preceding resolutions. There can be no stable, steady state for <span class="hi">Iraq</span> unless it is properly disarmed, and nor can there be stability for the region and the international community. What may appear to be containment to us is rearmament for Saddam.</p> <p pid=".273.1/4">We do not need to speculate on this, as we have witnessed it. A de facto policy of containment existed between 1998 and <span class="hi">2002</span> following the effective expulsion of inspectors by <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, and <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> refusal to comply with resolution 1284.</p> <p pid=".273.1/5">Far from keeping a lid on Saddam's ambitions, that period allowed him to rebuild his horrific arsenal, his chemical and biological weapons, and the means of delivering them against his enemies at home and abroad. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a> inspectors chart in their recent reports, which are before the House, how <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has refurbished prohibited equipment that had previously been destroyed by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCOM">UNSCOM</a>, the earlier inspectors. That equipment included rocket motor casting chambers and chemical processors. UNMOVIC has also found that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> used the four-year absence of inspectors—the so-called period of containment—to build a missile test stand capable of testing engines with over four times the thrust of the already prohibited al-Samoud 2 missile. All this happened during containment. There is no steady state—the choice is between disarmament or rearmament.</p> <p pid=".273.1/6">Thankfully, the so-called policy of containment ended on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-08">8 November</phrase> last year. Containment requires a degree of trust in Saddam that we cannot risk and which runs contrary to all the evidence. It means leaving Saddam as a standing example that defiance pays. We cannot allow Saddam further time and space to strengthen his capabilities and to rearm further. Only disarmament—the aim of all these <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> resolutions—can deal with this issue.</p></div>

I am often asked, "Isn't the west guilty of double standards, especially in relation to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_Palestine">Israel and Palestine</a>?" [Hon Members: "Yes."] Some of my hon. Friends say yes. I accept, as does my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, that there has been a considerable amount to this charge, and to the perception of double standards, which extends well beyond the Arab and Islamic world. However, we deal with this charge not by ignoring outstanding UN obligations, but by working even harder to see all of them implemented. The key ones on Israel/Palestine—242, 338, 1397—impose obligations on three sets of parties—on the Palestinians to end terrorism, on the Arab countries to end support for terrorism and to recognise the state of Israel, and on Israel fully to co-operate in the establishment of a viable state of Palestine with borders broadly based on those of 1967.</p></div>

Friend for giving way, and I welcome the Government's efforts to restart the peace process. However, the allegations and anger about double standards are not only to do with the lack of talks. They arise from the fact that, when a house in Gaza is destroyed, perhaps with the people in it, the destruction has probably been caused by an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-16">F-16</a>. That aeroplane has probably been supplied by the US and may have parts supplied by Britain. Moreover, when the olive grove is destroyed, the destruction is probably carried out by a bulldozer bankrolled from the US. If we are to avoid the allegation of double standards, we must get talks going, and ensure that UN resolutions are upheld and respected.</p></div>

And it requires the vision and foresight to act decisively and, if necessary, with military force.</p> <p pid=".275.17/3">Once Saddam's invasion of Kuwait had been turned back by the international community, the international community, with our agreement, put on hold the military option, preferring of course to resolve the continuing crisis peacefully, first through weapons inspections and then, from December 1998, through a policy of containment. However, neither of those approaches has worked.</p> <p pid=".275.17/4">Following the adoption of resolution 1441, Saddam has now to be under no illusions that there will be no further resolutions calling for containment, no further attempts to tinker at the margins rather than to remove his weapons. This has to be a moment of choice for Saddam and for the Iraqi regime.</p></div>

As I told the Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-05">5 February</phrase>, the UN's pre-war predecessor, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations">League of Nations</a>, had the same fine ideals as the UN. Yet the League failed because it could not create actions from its words: it could not back diplomacy with a credible threat and, where necessary, the use of force. Small evils therefore went unchecked, tyrants became emboldened, then greater evils were unleashed. At each stage good men and women said, "Not now, wait, the evil is not big enough to challenge." Then before their eyes, the evil became too big to challenge. We had slipped slowly down a slope, never noticing how far we had gone until it was too late. We owe it to our history as well as to our future not to make the same mistake again.</p> <p pid=".276.2/2">This is the hardest issue that I have ever had to deal with.

We have to face the issue.

It is the language that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> understands. It is based on the clear understanding that Saddam Hussein only begins to comply when his feet are held to the flames and the heat begins to take effect. Equally, it is based on the knowledge that, the moment the heat is turned off, he returns to his old threatening ways, as we have heard from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>.</p> <p pid=".277.1/3">The peaceful disarming of Hussein may, in the event, not be possible, but I believe that it has been right to try to do it. The Foreign Secretary has painted a very pessimistic picture in that regard today, but we know that, if there is to be a peaceful outcome, it will happen only if the determination of the international community to resort to force if necessary is clear and unambiguous.</p> <p pid=".277.1/4">Saddam Hussein has always taken ambiguity as a sign of weakness, so the last push for peace depends on his understanding clearly that there is no way out other than to disarm, and that the final opportunity that the Security Council signed up to in resolution 1441 means precisely what it says.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".278.6/1">I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for having raised that issue. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> will have heard what she said, but it is vital in the days and weeks ahead that hon. Members on both sides of the House continue to make it clear that this is a conflict not with Islam, but with a gangster who has weapons of mass destruction and who needs to be dealt with.</p> <p pid=".278.6/2">Today's debate will be one of deep but conflicting views. I have the greatest respect for those who hold strong and principled views on this difficult issue, even if those views may differ from mine, but I have no time for those who might seek to play politics with this issue, although it would have been easy to do so. It is far too serious for that. I also have very little time for those who have sought to face both ways. I look down the Benches to my left, at the leader of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>. Yesterday and today, he criticised what he called the pre-emptive draft resolution. Is this the leader of a party which, ever since resolution 1441 was passed, has insisted on a second resolution? Indeed, is this the leader of a party whose foreign affairs spokesman, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=781" title="Our page on Menzies Campbell - &#39;the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell)&#39;">Mr. Campbell</a>, told the House last year that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".278.6/3">"legally, no new resolution is required for the use of force to implement resolution 687."</p> <p pid=".278.6/4">He went on to say</p> <p class="indent" pid=".278.6/5">"that from a political and diplomatic point of view, a new United Nations resolution is essential".—[<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pop=1&amp;s=date:20020924+column:43+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 24 September <span class="hi">2002</span>; Vol. 390, c. 43–44</a>.]</p> <p pid=".278.6/6">Well, he was talking not about a second resolution, but about the resolution that turned out to be 1441, which he had already said was not legally required for force to be used. It really is time that the Liberal Democrats decided what their position on such resolutions is. Is this the party leader who told the recent anti-war rally that he would not support military action without a second UN resolution, only two weeks after his defence spokesman, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1013" title="Our page on Paul Keetch - &#39;the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch)&#39;">Mr. Keetch</a>, when asked, in my presence, whether he would feel bound by a second resolution endorsing military action announced that his party's foreign policy would not be dictated by the UN? What a tangled web! <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> has a right to know the clear and unambiguous position of the Liberal Democrats, and I hope that we will hear it today.</p></div>

I believe that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> poses a threat to international peace and security, and, therefore, to us. That is why we support the Government today. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> believes that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> poses a continuing threat to international peace and security, which is why 17 resolutions, including 1441, have been passed under chapter <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VII">VII</a> of the UN charter, which deals specifically with threats to the peace and permits military action. That was the point that I made when the matter was raised earlier. The draft resolution tabled on Monday in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> refers specifically to chapter VII. The threat flows neither from the evil of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> nor from the existence of weapons of mass destruction, but from the combination of the two.</p></div>

What is clear, as we have made plain for some time, is that a sole objective of regime change would be outwith the bounds of international law. But that is not the case in this instance. We are seeking the removal and elimination of weapons of mass destruction that are a threat because they are in the hands of a gangster who uses them not only to threaten his own people but, as we know, to threaten the countries around him. That is why the United Nations believes that he poses a threat to international security and peace.</p> <p pid=".281.5/2">I understand the doubts that are expressed about whether we have sufficient evidence to proceed in the direction that the Government have outlined. It would help to meet doubts, of course, if weapons of mass destruction could be disclosed or discovered now. I continue to hope that, as far as is consistent with maintaining the integrity and security of our intelligence, the Government may yet produce more tangible evidence than they have done so far. What we know already, however, is that the elements of such weapons of mass destruction and the programmes for developing them existed in 1999 when the last team of UN inspectors had to leave <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. We heard details from the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> yesterday of the spine-chilling extent and nature of those weapons: the anthrax, the nerve agents and the thousands of special munitions. We know from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCOM">UNSCOM</a> and from previous Iraqi declarations—let us not forget that—that those weapons were there then. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must believe that they are there now. It is not for the inspectors to prove that they are still there; it is for <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to demonstrate credibly that they are not. That is not my demand: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> made it clear on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January</phrase>, and set it more broadly as the test as to whether <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> was genuinely seeking to comply with resolution 1441.</p></div>

I welcome the undertaking that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has given in that regard.</p> <p pid=".282.5/2">In the interim, however, we need greater clarity on a number of important issues.

Most important is to do what is right. No international crisis is ever simple. No international questions are ever black and white. What is right and moral is sometimes difficult to discern. As I am sure we shall hear in this debate, matters are open to different interpretations. However, I am clear in my mind that, in the light of what we know, the direction and position of the Government in relation to this crisis is right. That is why, although it is not always the most comfortable or easy course, I believe that we owe the Government our support today. In the interests of the long-term security of our people, that is right. I urge my hon. Friends and right hon. Friends to support the motion.</p></div>

Members and right hon. Members from all sides of this House. Let us make no mistake. The Government motion before us talks—rightly—of the United Nations process. I welcome that. However, if the Government motion is passed unamended by this House, a signal will have been given that this House endorses the timetable that is now upon us—which will lead, I fear, inexorably to war within the next three to four weeks.</p> <p pid=".285.7/4">Three main arguments appear to be mounted in support of early military <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. The first is: "They have had the time to comply; they don't need more time." Actually, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has had 11 weeks since the weapons inspectors went in this time round. Let us not forget that, from 1991 to 1996–97, the weapons inspection process produced substantial results. Substantial amounts of chemical and biological warfare capacity were destroyed by the process. I would argue that a strongly supported weapons inspection process—one that is given the time to complete the job—is what the international community should be arguing for.</p></div>

That is the shallowest argument of all. Strength does not lie simply in military might. Strength lies in having an unanswerable case. It lies in making the right moral choices. It lies in maintaining the pressure, and it lies in securing the fullest possible international agreement. That is where our efforts should now be directed, but I fear that we may be cutting short those efforts by the timetable that is now upon us.</p></div>

We are talking about thousands—possibly hundreds of thousands—of innocent lives being lost. We are talking about casualties almost inevitably among our own forces. We are talking about instability across the whole middle east. We are talking about making the achievement of a solution to the Israel/Palestine question infinitely more difficult. We are talking about the alienation of moderate Muslim opinion across the world. One does not undertake such things lightly. One must have the clearest possible reasons for doing them, and I do not believe that those reasons are there.</p> <p pid=".287.1/2">This may be the last chance before our forces are committed to military action that the House has to make our view known. It grieves me that I am seeking to amend a motion tabled by my Government—a Government whom I applaud and support. However, these are serious times and the House must make a serious judgment. We must say here today in this Chamber that now is not the time, that the case has yet to be fully made and that war, with all its consequences, cannot be the present answer.</p></div>

On the assumption that the amendment is not passed, we will vote against the Government's motion.</p> <p pid=".287.4/2">We welcome the opportunity that this debate provides to discuss the critical issues facing the country. After three months and repeated requests for a debate, it has been a long time coming. However, it comes at a key moment in the development of the international situation.</p> <p pid=".287.4/3">We must send out an absolutely clear message. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> must be disarmed and his evil regime with it. Nobody disputes that. The question for us is how we go about that. Throughout the process, we have supported the United Nations and urged our Government and the United States of America to work through it. The international community is taking on Saddam Hussein because he defies international law, so it is absolutely essential that, as we tackle him, we follow the United Nations route; otherwise we will undermine the very principles and institutions in whose name we act.</p> <p pid=".287.4/4">It has not always been clear that that the United States of America has recognised that requirement. Even in the past 24 hours, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_President">United States President</a> has restated his belief that a second resolution against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is not required before military action can begin. That is a lonely view in the world but, sadly, an important one.</p> <p pid=".287.4/5">We acknowledge the United Kingdom's role in persuading the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Administration">United States Administration</a> to pursue their case via the United Nations in the first place. However, all of us must be concerned about the threats made to members of the Security Council if they ignore America's will, and concerned that, if they do, the United States will go its own way.</p></div>

This, too, is a dangerous notion. Will it allow other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to disregard a future use of the British veto? This pick-and-mix approach to international diplomacy is bad for Britain and it is worse still for the international community.</p> <p pid=".288.1/2">There is no doubt that the possibility of military action has been the catalyst for the return of the weapons inspectors and for the co-operation received from the Iraqi regime so far as it goes. However, there must be a difference between getting the military forces ready and using them. Much of the anxiety in the public's mind at present is because the United States' and the United Kingdom's rhetoric suggests that, once the build-up is complete, the military will go into action. Many fear that there is an unstoppable momentum towards war that is accentuated by the attempt to force the pace with a new draft resolution. Never mind the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Administration">United States Administration</a>'s ambivalence about the role of the UN and even the need for a second resolution. We must have a credible threat of force, but not a certain threat of force; otherwise the international order has everything to lose and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> has nothing to gain except by pre-emptive action of his own.</p></div>

Lady will bear with me and listen to the rest of my case, I hope that that will become absolutely clear to her.</p> <p pid=".288.3/2">International law is clear that war can only ever be justified as a last resort. In upholding it, we must show conclusively that that is so and that we will go to war only if all other diplomatic and political options have been exhausted. That is far from being the case at this point.</p> <p pid=".288.3/3">The current action against Saddam is justified by resolution 1441. The resolution was a supreme effort of international diplomacy that took eight weeks of patient negotiation. It was unanimously agreed and was all the stronger for that. It put a clear onus on Saddam, marked out the fact that this was his final opportunity, and gave a warning in respect of further material breaches and the serious consequences that would flow from them. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> must know that that involves the real possibility of military action, but we do not believe that the current resolution that was drafted and put before the United Nations is sufficient to justify any such development.</p> <p pid=".288.3/4">The weapons inspectors are the key to dealing with Saddam. They have got clear instructions; indeed, they could not be more specific. So far, the outcomes have been mixed, co-operation has been patchy and the inspectors have not been helped by the slow build-up in their resources and numbers, but can anybody doubt their seriousness, purpose or independence? It is their judgment that is crucial in this debate. Overnight, we have seen the release of new information—an important development that would suggest that the regime is co-operating with them—but we face an early test this weekend regarding the al-Samoud missile system and <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> willingness to dismantle it. Overall, this is a finely judged case, but in the circumstances, we must surely listen to the chief inspector when he says:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".288.3/5">"Eight years of inspections, four of no inspections, then 11 weeks and call it a day? It's a little short".</p></div>

The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> drew attention to the contrast between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and South Africa, but surely one of the key differences is that, in South Africa, the very points that the French memorandum sets out—a clear programme and timelines for inspection—were contained in the inspection regime.

In sorting them out, we must be clear about what we are setting out to do and how we will deal with the consequences. We are far from having reached that position at this point. It is important that, in due course, if there is to be a further resolution, we must have a debate in this House and a vote when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> armed forces are to be committed. At the key moment, when another UN resolution has been passed, that is absolutely vital.

[Hon. Members: "Oh, yes it does."] It does not mean that, as the media and—I was about to say idiots, but I had better not—Liberal Democrat Members say. War can be avoided by one simple act—<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> complying with the resolutions of the United Nations. All the pressure—not just our pressure, but the pressure from everywhere—should be on Saddam Hussein, not on Blair and Bush. The pressure should be on Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions. I am no fan of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>, but the hyperbole of the attacks and the comparisons that he has suffered is incredible. That does no one's cause any good. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> and United States Governments are working through the United Nations. We have heard that the weapons inspectors have found non-compliance on anthrax, on nerve agents and on long-range missiles. The evidence is now overwhelming, and we should be supporting the Government.</p> <p pid=".292.0/3">I do not doubt the sincerity of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of those who oppose Government policy, but I agree with <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=697" title="Our page on Michael Ancram - &#39;the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)&#39;">Mr. Ancram</a> that the Liberals and, I would add, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National">Scottish National</a> party, are attempting to use this issue—an issue of life and death—for party political purposes. As I said yesterday, that is irresponsible opportunism. They should be aware that Saddam Hussein is cleverly exploiting everything that they do, including my ex-right hon. Friend's patsy interview with him on television. I saw the marches that some of my colleagues took part in. They were reported with joy and glee on Iraqi television and they gave great succour to the dictator. I saw no placards on those marches saying, "Saddam must go". I saw no mention of the 2 million dead in the two wars, the Kurds who were gassed, the Iraqis who were exiled, or the hundreds of children who starve each day now because of Saddam Hussein's manipulation of the sanctions. Yet each day that passes without action to disarm Saddam Hussein means that more of those children will die and more members of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> will be persecuted. My colleagues should remember that there are consequences of inaction, as well as of action.</p></div>

I believe that the continued maintenance of that alliance is absolutely vital to our security, to that of other European nations and to that of the United States itself. I have no hesitation, in the right circumstances, in facing up to my responsibility to vote for the use of military force in the defence and support of vital national and international interests, so long as it is plain that it is a necessary last resort and all other means of proceeding have been satisfactorily exhausted. So I begin—obviously, I trust—from no anti-American, left-wing, peacenik position in approaching the problem.</p> <p pid=".293.1/2">Today's debate is the time to put down a marker to say that the other approaches—the diplomatic, deterrent policy and the use of threat in order to get compliance—have not yet been exhausted. I find myself attracted to the motion tabled in the name of <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1232" title="Our page on Chris Smith - &#39;the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith)&#39;">Mr. Smith</a>, in that if we ask ourselves today whether the case for war has yet been established, the House should say that it has not and that there is still a case for giving more time to other, peaceful alternatives for enforcing our objectives.</p></div>

                          </h2>


                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".293.5/1">We have had 12 years, in two or three of which people have done nothing at all. We have had 11 weeks of the present policy and we must judge whether a few weeks more are required.</p> <p pid=".293.5/2">Let me make clear the origin of my doubts about the very persuasive case that the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> sometimes put. I cannot rid myself of doubts that the course to war upon which we are now embarked was decided on many months ago, primarily in Washington, and there has been a fairly remorseless unfolding of events since that time. I am not alone in having heard and met American politicians of great distinction who gave the impression that a change of regime in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> was determined upon long ago and that the use of military force in a pre-emptive strike was justified in order to achieve that. I believe that in most cases the motives have been worthy and they genuinely believe that they are ridding themselves of an evil regime. I do not believe the conspiracy theorists. One can go on to hear theories about the installation of democracy in the Arab world, unfinished business from a previous Administration, and a reaction to the understandable state of political opinion in the United States of America in the aftermath of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>.</p> <p pid=".293.5/3">If war happens in the next few weeks—that is a genuine possibility—hon. Members must ask themselves whether it is legitimate to believe that such action had already been determined and had been remorselessly unfolding for many months. Many people believe that. It is why middle England and those of moderate political opinions have so many doubts. To many of my constituents, the answer to the questions, "Did Washington determine such action many months ago?" and "Could the President seek re-election without war and the removal of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> president?" is as obvious as the reply to "Does the emperor have clothes?" The Government must respond to that formidable case.</p> <p pid=".293.5/4">However, I praise the Government for their actions: first, they put themselves in the classic Churchillian position, followed by every subsequent Government, of being America's closest ally in a great diplomatic crisis to gain the maximum possible influence over the exercise of power. I trust that any Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and Foreign Secretary of this country would have done that. Secondly, they went to the United Nations and led it towards the path of diplomacy and peaceful coercion, which, I trust, the House would prefer if it achieved the desired effect. The result was resolution 1441, for which I voted. It plainly paves the way to war, if necessary, in setting out the conditions for endeavouring to put together an international coalition that would enforce the United Nations' will when all other means had been exhausted.</p> <p pid=".293.5/5">The resolution turns on the question whether a material breach has occurred. Although other concerns cannot be brushed aside, the revolting nature of the Iraqi regime and its cruelty, much though we deplore it, is not a legal basis for war. We must concentrate on whether there are weapons of mass destruction, whether disarmament can be induced and, if not, whether force will be used to effect it.</p> <p pid=".293.5/6">The Government introduce other matters to strengthen their claim. Even today, the Prime Minister asked us to listen to <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a>. I shall do that, doubtless with a sense of shock and shared anxiety about the Iraqi regime's outrageous behaviour. The word "attitude" has also been used today, as though the Iraqi regime's attitude to disarmament is a new and exciting concept.</p> <p pid=".293.5/7">However, the question that we must ask is whether a material breach has occurred. To me, that means considering whether demonstrable evidence exists to show that biological and chemical weapons are held in conditions and circumstances in which they pose a current threat to neighbours or to us. There is no evidence of links with al-Qaeda and I do not believe that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> poses a threat to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> or London. To claim that is to insult our intelligence. However, I wish to know whether demonstrable evidence exists of sufficient quantities of weapons to pose a threat. I doubt that.</p> <p pid=".293.5/8">I am glad to say that <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> army is degraded and in a weaker position than in 1991. I do not believe <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>; he probably has material around <span class="hi">Iraq</span> that he has not disclosed and we need to pursue that rigorously. However, is it in a condition to be deployed as a threat to anybody? That has not yet been demonstrated and we should not go to war until it has.</p> <p pid=".293.5/9">Use of threat and reverting to the policies of international diplomacy and deterrence that we used in the cold war have been successful. Every <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">speaker</a> so far has conceded that coercion has moved Saddam. That shows that the policy is working. It does not mean that we have reached the stage of abandoning deterrence, coercion and threat and deciding that the weather is unfortunately getting warmer in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, that 250,000 people, including a large part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a>, are there and either we must bring people home in the next few weeks or they must open fire.</p> <p pid=".293.5/10">Any war will be won easily. I am glad that if we go to war, it will not take long. However, we should consider alternatives because of the consequences of war. How many terrorists will we recruit in the greater, long-standing battle against international terrorism? It will be far harder to win. What will we do to the stability of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, Pakistan or Egypt? What sort of leadership will replace that which might be deposed? The Government never address those questions satisfactorily, as my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> Foreign Secretary said. However, they will have to live with the answers.</p> <p pid=".293.5/11">The next time a large bomb explodes in a western city, or an Arab or Muslim regime topples and is replaced by extremists, the Government must consider the extent to which the policy contributed to it. That is why hon. Members should pause and why, unless evidence is produced for a breach and a material threat, my judgment today is that we should not go to war. I therefore support the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury tabled.</p></div>

Surely the House should also be allowed to express an opinion.</p> <p pid=".296.1/2">The Foreign Secretary said two things in answer to the question, "Why <span class="hi">Iraq</span>?" He subdivided them into two further points. First, he claimed that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> posed an exceptional danger, and he gave defiance of the United Nations as the second reason. Many arguments have been presented about defying the UN. Indeed, the Foreign Secretary mentioned UN resolutions that referred to all countries in the middle east, including Israel, and specifically to making that region a nuclear-free zone.</p> <p pid=".296.1/3">Although there are differences of opinion, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe presented very well the case against a thoroughly emasculated <span class="hi">Iraq</span> posing an exceptional danger. Like him, I anticipate that the overwhelming force in place to deal with <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is of such a nature that a campaign would, hopefully, be relatively short and sharp. What we cannot guarantee, however, is the amount of collateral damage that would ensue— apart from the wholly undesirable political outcomes, of course.</p> <p pid=".296.1/4">The Foreign Secretary asked the rhetorical question, "Why now?" People who think that it is a matter of us running out of patience misunderstand the mechanics of what is going on. The decision was made not in Downing street or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a>, but in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House">White House</a>. We are all Philadelphia lawyers now and know all about the fascinating weapons of mass destruction, but anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of American military doctrine since <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a> and the first Gulf war knows that we are missing the obvious. It has taken until now, and it is still not finalised, to mobilise and deploy the troops and units needed to hold a campaign that accords with an American military doctrine that is nearly coming to a conclusion. Oddly, hon. Members will have noticed from today's new reports that space has been allocated in the middle east for only seven of the 70-odd British planes. The hard reality is that it will be an American military campaign.</p> <p pid=".296.1/5">The reasons for the campaign are complex. It is not just a matter of oil or of the President avenging daddy's unfinished business; the ideological hawks in the US Administration have set out their stall for many years. They have set out, transparently and consistently, the different hopes and aims to which they aspire. I mentioned the undesirable outcomes. We must not forget, as our <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> confirmed at the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you&#39;ve ever seen inside the Commons, you&#39;ll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> when his <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> heckled him, that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a> will be next. We can write the script: Iran, Syria, Libya. People in Iran must be worried, and we do not know where it will end. That is not conjecture; the objectives of the new pax Americana have been set out clearly and unequivocally.</p> <p pid=".296.1/6">We should leave it to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> and el-Baradei to make the definitive statement on weapons of mass destruction and let the United Nations decide whether a material breach has taken place. There are two prerequisites for British public opinion on that.</p></div>

It must be based on credible evidence, and that will not be provided by the political imperatives of the US or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> Governments, or anyone else for that matter. I recommend that people read <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Riegle">Senator Riegle</a>'s report, published by his Senate Committee, on where the biological weapons originated. It is a matter of congressional record and anyone can get a copy. There were 73 separate consignments, including everything from botulinum toxin to other horrors, such as anthrax. Those were exported to Saddam by the United States. None of us is lily white. I know that that does not help to deal with the problem, but it ill behoves people to stand up as purer than Caesar's wife on the issue.</p> <p pid=".297.1/3">I urge hon. Members on both sides of the House to consider the fact that it is extremely unlikely that we will be afforded an opportunity to debate the problem substantively. I hear what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said, but I also heard what the Labour party chairman said. I wage that it will be extremely problematic for Members of this House to connect with public opinion in our constituencies, parties, the nation at large and internationally, and to express our views. We can do that now only by accepting the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. It rules nothing out; it asks only that we consider that the case is not yet proven. That gives all concerned the leeway to make their case. Hon. Members should not miss out on the opportunity to reconnect with the overwhelming consensus of the British people.</p></div>

During the weekend following <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, I was at a dinner party in Islington. While the corpses were still being taken out the wreckage of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Centre">World Trade Centre</a>, the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament.

They thought that in the preceding years, the United States had arrogantly thrown its weight about in the world. My view is the opposite. The background to 9/11 was a decade in which the west had failed to show fixity of purpose and had neglected to offer deterrence to its enemies. The United States, in particular, had repeatedly come under attack from extremists without offering any effective response.</p> <p pid=".298.0/3">In the 1990s, there was the first attack on the World Trade Centre. That was followed by the bombing of American barracks in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, the bombs at American embassies in east Africa, and then the attack on the US warship Cole. Those outrages represented a classic escalation. In retrospect, each inadequate response to each outrage showed a lack of determination that was taken as a sign of weakness, and that emboldened our enemies.</p></div>

They advertised to Saddam the infirmity of purpose of the west. Both Saddam and al-Qaeda, separately, could take comfort from the clear evidence that the west was not willing to take firm action. That is the connection between al-Qaeda and Saddam. I think it reasonable that after <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> the United States reviewed its security and the failure of deterrence. It concluded that if we continued to let Saddam to get away with things and to go his own way, our vulnerability would increase.</p> <p pid=".298.6/3">The world has its fair share of wicked leaders and terrorists, and they will do whatever they can get away with. They listen to what we say but, more to the point, they watch what we do. As the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> rightly says, if the civilised world is not prepared to make its words stick now, its determination will always be doubted because political will is crucial.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".299.1/1">I think I have covered that point. I must admit that, in my view, Members who persist in saying "We have been wrong over a period of 12 or 13 years, and we must therefore be wrong to try and put our mistakes right now" are on very weak ground.</p> <p pid=".299.1/2">In an important sense, Saddam and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_Laden">Bin Laden</a> are co-belligerents. They share a hatred of the west, and a belief in the efficacy of terror. Let me add that if Britain tried to stand aside—here I disagree with my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=802" title="Our page on Kenneth Clarke - &#39;the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#39;">Mr. Clarke</a>—that would not spare us from the terror. A display of weakness will bring more terror, not less; and I think it is a dangerous myth to believe that terrorism is in some way beyond deterrence .</p> <p pid=".299.1/3">The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s task has been made more difficult—I admit this—because America has not been willing to say much about the middle east peace process. I think that the United States is strictly correct to reject any link between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and the regional peace process, but there are many indirect links. Certainly, I believe it might have been easier for the Government to try to establish direct connections between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organisation">Palestine Liberation Organisation</a> than to try to establish them between <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and al-Qaeda. It is clear that Saddam is the hero of the Palestinian suicide bombers.</p> <p pid=".299.1/4">Many today have focused on the dangers to the region if there is a conflict. Of course there are dangers, but I say that if <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is disarmed there are opportunities too. The United States will then engage in the middle east peace process; but it will do so with an unambiguous hostility to terrorism. A new Palestinian leadership will then understand that terrorism will not work, and that therefore political engagement may.</p> <p pid=".299.1/5">Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> Sharon may be ruthless in war, but he would also be ruthless in peace. The peace will require Israel to give up land, positions and settlements, and Mr. Sharon is the man to force such an outcome on the Israelis.</p> <p pid=".299.1/6">As the Prime Minister said yesterday, <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is a potentially rich country. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Devizes said today, it is a country with a middle class and educated people. If economic and political freedoms are returned to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, that can have a powerful effect on a region in which those liberties are largely absent. Perhaps Iran too will flip towards the moderates.</p> <p pid=".299.1/7">This crisis has cost the west dearly in terms of the damage to its institutions. New institutions may be required. I am a great supporter of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>, but it is damaged, and in any case it is geographically very limited. I believe that we should look for a new organisation, not to replace NATO but to stand alongside it. The aim of that organisation would be to counter terrorism, and its focus would be global. The United States, Britain and Australia would certainly be founder members of the new organisation; perhaps its headquarters would be in Prague or Madrid. Whatever the precise form of that new organisation, I believe that its time has come.</p></div>

As it happens, it was included in that constitution on the initiative of one <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Wedgwood_Benn">Anthony Wedgwood Benn</a>, who at that time was a staunch supporter of the United Nations rather than the toady to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> that he has since become.</p> <p pid=".300.0/4">The fact is that the United Nations has passed a series of mandatory resolutions on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> following that country's serial aggressions and violations of human rights, and <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has violated every one. Since I expressed my concerns last summer the Security Council has passed resolution 1441. I must say that the constant moving of the goal posts is a sign of the inadequacy of some of the arguments being advanced. First, Members said "Let us have a resolution"; we got a resolution. Then some Members said "Let us have a second resolution"; a second resolution has been tabled. Now there is a motion on the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=5" title="The order paper is issued daily and lists the business which will be dealt..." class="glossary">Order Paper</a> referring not just to a second resolution but to lots of other conditions, including a debate in the House before military action. My right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has conceded that as well. At what point do we have a consistent position? At what point do we lay down conditions and say that those conditions must be met?</p> <p pid=".300.0/5">Resolution 1441 reiterates all the previous resolutions since 1990, and lays down a process for its implementation together with a statement of the consequences if it is not obeyed by Saddam Hussein. The resolution could not be clearer; I assume that all Members have read it. While a further resolution may be regarded as desirable—and my right hon. Friends are attempting to obtain one—it is certainly not indispensable. Resolution 1441 lays down all the necessary conditions.</p></div>

What he said was incontrovertible. If Saddam can get away with the games he is playing, stringing out the process until it is vitiated and nullified, the consequences for world order will be catastrophic. I cannot understand my colleagues who argue that, given a little or a lot more time, Saddam will suddenly display a change of heart. It is what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Dalton">Hugh Dalton</a> used to call the doctrine of unripe time, and it is the basis of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p> <p pid=".301.3/2">Yet there is a further consequence.

That may be a despairing argument for voting for the Government motion tonight, but it is realistic and, I believe, incontrovertible. Moreover, if the role of the United Nations is set aside, we have no hope whatever of solving the agonising <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-Palestinian">Israeli-Palestinian</a> confrontation. Even now, it is possible for our Prime Minister to persuade Bush to participate in the initiatives necessary to obtain peace in the middle east. Success in this issue may persuade Bush that there could be success in that issue too. However, I do not believe that a middle east peace process would be possible if the United States retreated into self-interested isolationism, which is only too prevalent in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House">White House</a> and the Pentagon. Every hon. Member will search her or his conscience in deciding how to vote tonight. I have searched mine and, as I said, all my colleagues will have done so. Even though all our hearts are heavy, I have no doubt that it is right to vote with the Government tonight.</p></div>

Yesterday, in the exchanges after the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s admirable statement, I put it to him—the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> made this point this afternoon—that if we allow the international community to be set at naught by a tyrant whose evil, if not without parallel, has not been exceeded in the past half century or more, the United Nations will go the way of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations">League of Nations</a>. At stake—this was implicit in the speech of my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1164" title="Our page on Michael Portillo - &#39;the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo)&#39;">Mr. Portillo</a>—is the credibility of the international order in standing up uncompromisingly to evil. Like everyone else, I hope that we will not have a war, but action against <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> will be wholly justified if he continues to flout the will of the international community.</p> <p pid=".303.5/3">In that context, let us remember that the weapons inspectors are not employed as weapons discoverers. They are there to inspect what Saddam Hussein declares. He has repeatedly made false declarations, and the evidence is before us. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a> that the Government provided for every Member as background reading for this debate makes it plain that time after time this man has thumbed his nose at the international community and has wrought terrible havoc on his own people. I urge Liberal Members to go to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberal_Club">National Liberal Club</a> and look at the portrait of Mr. Gladstone. They should remember those amazing speeches that he made during the Bulgarian atrocities in which he talked about clearing out the Turks</p> <p class="indent" pid=".303.5/4">"bag and baggage from the province they have desolated and profaned."</p> <p pid=".303.5/5">If anybody has desolated and profaned the province over which he rules it is Saddam Hussein.</p> <p pid=".303.5/6">We are now at a critical juncture in the history of this new century. If we allow this evil tyrant to get away with it, we will advance into the century with no credible international organisations and with our own credibility, and therefore the defence of our very people, at risk. I urge the House to reject the well-meaning <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> tabled by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1232" title="Our page on Chris Smith - &#39;the right hon.

We are buffeted by pressure and arguments on all sides but, at the end of the day, we are impelled to make a rational decision. I have looked at the resolution, and shall vote on it, and not one that may be made in future. There is nothing exceptional about that—I do not feel prejudiced, nor is my conscience undermined by decision to go into the Lobby with the Government and the official <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>.</p> <p pid=".304.0/2">I have long believed that the US and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> should go down the Security Council route. I have unequivocally supported all those who supported 1441, and I have strongly supported, at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">United States Congress</a>, as has the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Committee">Defence Committee</a>, a further resolution—not that it is necessary legally, but it is certainly necessary politically to gain endorsement and justification from a larger number of individuals and nations than have hitherto given support. The Defence Committee went to Washington and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> a couple of weeks ago. We met the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Armed_Services_Committee">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> and senior people from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council">National Security Council</a>, the Department of Defense and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Department">State Department</a>. There was hardly anybody whom we met, bar the commissionaire in the Watergate hotel, whom we did not press strongly for a second resolution. I am delighted that efforts are being made to achieve that.</p> <p pid=".304.0/3">Is Saddam co-operating fully with 1441 and the other 16 or 17 resolutions? Of course he is not. Dr. Blix and others have said that he is co-operating reluctantly with the process, but he is not co-operating in substance. It has been said endlessly, and I repeat, that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a>'s role is not to search down holes or in caves but to verify whether <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> has been compliant. Dr. Blix said that in his speech to the United Nations; and the Defence Committee was privileged to listen to him privately for one hour and five minutes the day before he made his presentation and, I am sure, before he had written it.</p> <p pid=".304.0/4">During his formal presentation, Dr. Blix said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".304.0/5">"The declaration submitted by <span class="hi">Iraq</span> on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-07">7 December</phrase>, despite its large volume, missed the opportunity to provide the fresh material and evidence needed to respond to the open questions."</p> <p pid=".304.0/6">He continued:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".304.0/7">"Although I can understand that it may not be easy for <span class="hi">Iraq</span> in all cases to provide the evidence needed, it is not the task of the inspectors to find it.</p> <p class="indent" pid=".304.0/8"><span class="hi">Iraq</span> must squarely tackle this task and avoid belittling the questions."</p> <p pid=".304.0/9">So the inspectors are seeking assurances, which up to now have not been provided.</p> <p pid=".304.0/10">The example of the al-Samoud missile is well worth considering. There are three variations of it, two in existence and one on a drawing board. It is obvious from what Dr. Blix has seen that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is in material breach in relation to the missile, which in 13 out of the 40 tests has shown that it is capable of flying farther than the distance laid down for it by the United Nations.</p> <p pid=".304.0/11">If one considers each of the flagrant breaches, the obfuscations, the untruths and all the evidence that has been provided, one reaches the inescapable conclusion that Saddam Hussein has hidden, is hiding and is not compliant. One asks how much longer should one search. Yes, weeks more—there must be flexibility—but if anyone argues that Dr. Blix should be given 10 or 12 months to complete the job, I am afraid they are barking.</p></div>

I have no intention of giving way to him.</p> <p pid=".305.5/2">There are many hon. Members who are not persuaded by the evidence so far presented, and I respect their views.

He was right. On Kosovo, there was even more opposition. He was right. On Afghanistan, he was right. Therefore I am prepared to give his judgment further endorsement. I have heard no reason why his perspective should be trashed, as many have suggested.</p> <p pid=".305.5/6">I approach war, if it is to take place, with trepidation. It is not something to which anyone looks forward. The more one speaks to military personnel, the clearer it becomes that war must be undertaken as a last resort. I hope very much that there will be a second resolution and that pressure will be put on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. I, like many others, have said over the months that the only way to put pressure on him so that war will be superfluous is to let him see that the various countries of the world are so united that he has no option. Ironically, the greater the pressure, the less likely he is to resist.</p> <p pid=".305.5/7">There was an amazing demonstration a week ago; it was extremely impressive. I have read a number of biographies of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Hardie">Keir Hardie</a>. There was a massive anti-war demonstration on <phrase class="date" code="1914-08-02">2 August 1914</phrase>, organised by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Labour">Independent Labour</a> party.

One of the very few who opposed the Labour party was the great hero of the Labour party, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a>. The following day war was declared.</p> <p pid=".305.5/8">Although one must pay serious attention to public opinion, ultimately—this sounds an appalling argument, using Burke, who was not a democrat—we owe our constituents our judgment. I have spoken to so many people, been to so many meetings and read so much documentation, and my own view is that Saddam Hussein is not to be trusted. I hope that there will be a second resolution, and I hope that the pressure on him will be so enormous that there will be no need to go to war. That is what I yearn for.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".306.0/1">Hearing my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=820" title="Our page on Patrick Cormack - &#39;the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)&#39;">Sir Patrick Cormack</a> is an exhilarating experience. He is like a bottle of 1970 port, which improves with maturity. Today he showed, as he always does, sound judgment. He brings to these debates an engaging Barchester view. We get a report from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_House">Church House</a>, and it is not irreverent, as mine would be—all gas and gaiters. He is serious in his criticism of the Synod of the Church of England and says that it is seriously misguided, as it is, and as are so many of those who have signed the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> tabled by the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury.</p> <p pid=".306.0/2">I was saddened by the amendment and by the fallacious arguments adduced by the right hon. Gentleman. First, he said that Her Majesty's Government were not giving <span class="hi">Iraq</span> time, as though 12 years since the end of the Gulf were not time enough. One should recall that the ceasefire at the end of the Gulf war was conditional on the full implementation by <span class="hi">Iraq</span> of UN resolutions. Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman said that perhaps there was not total co-operation, but possibly 70 per cent.—a figure challenged by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, and rightly so. There is virtually no evidence of any significant co-operation with the arms inspectors or of compliance with UN resolution 1441. The right hon. Gentleman then said that the Government were anxious that his amendment might give comfort to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. Nothing gives greater comfort to Saddam Hussein than the infirmity of purpose and the divisions that we have seen in the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>.</p> <p pid=".306.0/3">Fourthly, the right hon. Gentleman said that Saddam Hussein believed that caution was appeasement and that this was an utterly wrong belief on the part of the President of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. It is perplexing, naive, simplistic and highly dangerous to think, as the right hon. Gentleman does, that Saddam Hussein is open to moral persuasion. Strength is the only thing that he understands. The right hon. Gentleman might think that strength lies not only in military might, but Saddam Hussein and his ilk most certainly do not agree.</p> <p pid=".306.0/4">The notion of peaceful coercion, as advanced by my right hon. and learned Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=802" title="Our page on Kenneth Clarke - &#39;the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#39;">Mr. Clarke</a>, is a thoroughly dangerous illusion. It is a contradiction in terms. The earlier sedentary <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> by my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1045" title="Our page on Julian Lewis - &#39;the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)&#39;">Dr. Lewis</a> put it very well: it is like feeding the crocodiles. That was his comment to the Liberal spokesman, and it was highly pertinent. If we wish to deter the dangerous process of weapons proliferation, and particularly the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the way to do it is to deal effectively with Saddam Hussein and to do it fast. Time is not on our side; that is why he is trying to string us along. The faster military action is taken, the better. We all know that it will be much harder for the allied forces in the summer season. We cannot keep them marching up and down the frontiers of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, and there comes a time when enough is enough. That time is approaching fast. If effective action is taken, it is much less likely that the dictator who runs Korea will maintain his weapons programme, and other potential proliferators such as the Iranians and the Libyans will be deterred, too.</p> <p pid=".306.0/5">Unity of purpose is absolutely crucial, however. We learned that when facing down the dictators during the cold war. I find it so sad that the allies who brought succour to the beleaguered people of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin">West Berlin</a> in 1948—the United States, the United Kingdom and France—should not be wholly together and that France should be diverging its purposes today. I recall, too, as will many other hon. Members, the deployment by the Soviets of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS20">SS20</a> ballistic missiles. We faced down that crisis in the face of public <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> and opposition in some quarters of the House, especially in the Labour ranks. We did so, and there was unity of purpose in the alliance, not least on the part of the federal <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Government">German Government</a>, who were courageous then, but today seem frankly to be on the other side. That grieves me.</p> <p pid=".306.0/6">It is also interesting to note that those with the firmness of purpose that we seek are those who have suffered most from dictatorship. It is not we western Europeans who are showing total resolution—this Government are, to their credit—but the central and eastern Europeans: the Poles, the Czechs, the Bulgarians and others. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poles">The Poles</a> remember what happened to their people at the time of Solidarity when martial law was imposed by Jaruzelski. The Czechs remember the Soviet tanks rolling into Prague in '68. The Hungarians remember what happened to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Nagy">Imre Nagy</a> in 1956. It is sad that the Liberal party has become so wayward today.</p> <p pid=".306.0/7">Saddam Hussein knows that those who are not against him are for him. It is therefore crucial for the future of our alliance and the security of our continent that the European members of the alliance as a whole should get behind the United States as we are, see that resolution 1441 is fully implemented—and fast—and that Saddam Hussein is seen down.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".308.0/1">How extraordinary that my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=908" title="Our page on Bruce George - &#39;the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)&#39;">Mr. George</a> should pray in aid of this war what happened in Britain in 1914. That war was one that neither side wanted to fight, but because they had both turned up for the show, they thought that they had to go through with it. Yes, my right hon. Friend is right: despite <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Hardie">Keir Hardie</a>, the first world war was fought and there are a lot of white crosses in France and the low countries to prove it—an anthem for doomed youth that killed the flower of European civilisation.</p> <p pid=".308.0/2">We were told here that this was not a resolution for war, and that it was the last push for peace. Well, listening to the consensus between the two Front Benches, it sounded awfully like war to me. I do not know what it did for the enemy, but it didn't half frighten me. It is entirely possible that the teenage scribblers who made that spin earlier this week on the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s behalf that today's resolution was about peace, not war, have not read <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s "1984". After all, the same teenage scribblers told us last week on the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s behalf that this was going to be a six-day war, drawing on the illusion of the apparent triumph of the Israeli armies over the Arabs in 1967. They entirely missed the point that, on the day that the six-day war ended, the 35-year war began. That is precisely the point that the supporters of this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>—which merely asks us to conclude that the case for war has not yet been proven—are making. However short and sharp this war is—I place on record that I do not believe that it will be either short or sharp—its consequences, its reverberations and its seismic impact will disfigure life in this country and around the world for as long as the Members here present are still with us.</p> <p pid=".308.0/3">This is a defining moment. For the first time in many years, Parliament has an opportunity truly to shape world events. I have spent the last months talking virtually daily to American broadcasters and journalists, and I can tell the House that if this Parliament sends the message tonight that the British people are not with this adventure, it will have a decisive impact on opinion in the United States of America. We are always told that it is too early to vote on war until it is too late. This is our last opportunity meaningfully to affect the course of these great events, and hon. Members are fooling themselves if they do not acknowledge that. We all know what the public want. Every Member knows what their constituents would like to read about them in the newspapers tomorrow. Every Member on the Labour Benches knows what the members of their <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> party would like to read about them tomorrow. Let me quote our leader:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".308.0/4">"The people are the masters. We are the servants of the people. We will never forget that, and if ever we do, the people will very soon show that what the electorate gives, the electorate can take away."</p> <p pid=".308.0/5">Those words were spoken by our Prime Minister when that new dawn broke in 1997.</p> <p pid=".308.0/6">This debate is about one man, and it is not the man they want us to think it is about. This is about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W">George W</a>. Bush. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that they do not like to hear this. As my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1009" title="Our page on Gerald Kaufman - &#39;the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman)&#39;">Mr. Kaufman</a> said, this is the most distasteful American Administration that he has seen in his long lifetime. This is an American presidency that people on the Labour Benches would not have been seen dead with. This is an Administration who made Texas the execution chamber of the world, who broke all the international treaties, who walked away from every international effort held dear by Labour Members. <i>[Interruption.]</i> They don't like it up 'em because they know that what I am saying is the truth. They are standing against Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Tutu, Thabo Mbeki and with George Bush, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wolfowitz">Paul Wolfowitz</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Perle">Richard Perle</a>. That is the bottom line.</p> <p pid=".308.0/7">This matter can be resolved by the man prayed in aid by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> eight times in the course of his address—Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a>. The Foreign Secretary may not know it, but in the German press tomorrow, Dr. Blix will ask for exactly what our amendment this evening asks. It is no good pretending to be with the UN and Hans Blix and then slapping him in the face when he asks for more time to complete the job that he has already begun and which is bearing fruit.</p> <p pid=".308.0/8">There is no doubt that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Administration">United States Administration</a> would like to go forward into this war. There is no doubt in Labour Members' minds and hearts, however much they protest, that that born-again, right-wing, Bible-belting, fundamentalist Republican Administration in the United States want war, but they cannot have their war without the support of Great Britain. The vast <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of people in Great Britain are against the war. We know that to be true: we are asking Parliament to reflect it. We have a great opportunity this evening and I hope that my hon. Friends will not throw it away.</p></div>

Of course, we could be right to go to war even if neither of those groups were convinced, except that there has to be life after war. That is the problem. If we go to war in circumstances in which neither our own people nor the wider world are convinced, we will not be seen for what we believe ourselves to be, which is merely the handmaid of the United Nations and the enforcer of peace in circumstances in which there was no alternative.</p> <p pid=".310.1/2">The alternative is the issue. There can be no just war unless it is the only possibility. That is the number one explanation of the basis on which a nation may go to war. It defends itself because it can do nothing else. It goes to the aid of someone else because that person is being attacked. However, it must have an absolute assurance that it could not do anything else. That is why it is right to suggest that the case for military action against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is as yet unproven.</p> <p pid=".310.1/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> believes that he can make great gains if he is given time. Of course, he cannot have a veto on the matter. I do not support those who suggest that he can go on asking for more time for as long as he likes. However, it is not unreasonable when a man has had 11 weeks in this stage of the process to give him some more time. People argue that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> has had enough time, but I am not asking for time for him: I am asking for time for Hans Blix, which is rather different.</p> <p pid=".310.1/4">We are now in a situation in which the western world—to some extent, the whole world—has devoted large resources to press, to squeeze and to demand of Saddam Hussein. We have not yet gone as far as we could, short of war. Much of what is being done could be enlarged, short of war, inexorably to press Saddam Hussein so that he knows that it is not the preamble to a gradual reduction of pressure, but the slow and certain steps that will lead in the end to war.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".310.3/1">No, I will not. The issue for us is whether we should, at this moment, lose sight of the important and necessary precondition for a just war by taking action before it is utterly clear to the world that it is the only possible route.</p> <p pid=".310.3/2">I turn now to the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Devizes. There is no <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> who does not know that this war is war by timetable, and the timetable was laid down before the United States had any intention of going to the United Nations. I speak as one who has been a supporter of strong military action. After all, I supported the Cruise and Pershing missiles, and other strong nuclear weapons, when the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> was a member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a>. I do not, therefore, accept any suggestion that I am being weak in these circumstances. The truth is that it must be seen by the world that when, or if, we invade <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, we do so not because of some prearranged timetable, connected with ulterior motives, but because we and the world are convinced that there is no alternative. That is the message that should be given to those who argue the case from moral grounds.</p> <p pid=".310.3/3">I would have a great deal of sympathy for the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> if he said, "I am a politician. I do not listen to clergymen and others on political issues. I am the politician, and I can therefore make those decisions." It is a serious matter that almost without exception those for whom morality is at the centre of their vocation do not believe that the conditions for the just war are yet fulfilled. I would hope that a Prime Minister who believes in the moral case would at least hesitate in his timing when he finds himself opposed by those who are not themselves against war, but who know better what the conditions of the just war are. Those conditions are not yet fulfilled.</p> <p pid=".310.3/4">One of the problems that beset us is the fact that some people mistake impatience for necessity. Of course we are impatient to get rid of this horrific man, to destroy this regime which has destroyed so many others, to rid the world of a despicable dictator. But we do ourselves wrong if we do not choose the moment when the case for war has been made to those who afterwards must make us able to make the peace.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".311.0/1">I speak as someone who supported military action by our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> in Kosovo and Afghanistan, and before that supported military action in the Gulf war to expel <span class="hi">Iraq</span> from Kuwait. My only criticism is that the Americans and British at that time did not finish the job, because my understanding is that regime change then would have been permissible under international law.</p> <p pid=".311.0/2">I have to say however that, sadly, I am simply not convinced that all-out military action in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> can be justified at this time and on the scale envisaged. I do not doubt for a minute the sincerity and morality of my right hon. Friends the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, or those who support them. I share their concerns about weapons of mass destruction, about the vile and murderous Iraqi regime, about terrorism and about the need to uphold the United Nations. And I recognise, as we all must, that every alternative course of action before the House today is likely to result in protracted misery and a large number of deaths for the people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. The Government argue that these concerns justify virtually immediate military action, and that they would be resolved by that military action. I find those claims less and less convincing.</p> <p pid=".311.0/3">In relation to weapons of mass destruction, I do not believe that the Government have made a case that the existing policy of containment, backed up by increased coercion and inspection, is bound to fail.</p> <p pid=".311.0/4">I do not believe that the Government have made the case that, after 12 years of not protecting the Iraqi people from their vile and oppressive regime, it is now a moral imperative that we do it within the next few weeks. In any case, we are saying that regime change is not one of our objectives.</p> <p pid=".311.0/5">I do not believe that we have made the case that there is any connection between the current Iraqi regime and al-Qaeda.</p> <p pid=".311.0/6">In relation to upholding the authority and reputation of the United Nations, I ask whether anything could undermine the authority of the United Nations more than the United States announcing in advance that unless the United Nations agrees with its policy the United States will ignore the United Nations. The United States cannot claim to be the sheriff executing a warrant that its court has not granted it.</p> <p pid=".311.0/7">Even less convincing are the claims of the United States about the enforcement of international obligations, when we consider its failure to implement Kyoto, join the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court">International Criminal Court</a> or obey the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation">World Trade Organisation</a>. It is tending to behave rather like a maverick state. A small maverick state is a bit of a nuisance. It is a real problem for the rest of the world if the only remaining super-power turns maverick. My right hon. Friend the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was wise and sensible to recognise the danger of that prospect and to try to reduce it by reining in the activities of the United States and getting it to go along the United Nations route. He deserves great credit for what he has achieved. But there is a danger of following the example of the Israeli Labour party, which joined the Sharon coalition to restrain him and ended up by getting nothing but the blame at the end of the process.</p> <p pid=".311.0/8">It may be that the United States is strong enough to shrug off any consequences of the actions it intends to take. Britain may not be in as strong a position.</p> <p pid=".311.0/9">If there is a war, it is likely to be quick. It may not be, but it is likely to be. Even if there is a quick win, what will the result be? I am sure that the Iraqi people—those who survive—will welcome the overthrow of the current regime, but we have no answers to the question of how <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will be governed, who will govern it and whether the internal struggles that might result will spill over into neighbouring states in a way that might be a threat to international peace and security. I am sure that the ruling elites in the neighbouring states will welcome the overthrow of Saddam, but what of their peoples? They will see double standards: action to uphold UN resolutions on <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, but no action to uphold UN resolutions on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_Palestine">Israel and Palestine</a>. Many will regard that as anti-Islam. From my personal knowledge of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, I know that there is not one jot of truth in that view in terms of British Government policy; however, I cannot necessarily say the same for the United States.</p> <p pid=".311.0/10">People in the middle east recognise that the current Administration in the United States are in power partly because of the support of Christian fundamentalists, some of whom publicly believe that the borders of Israel should be extended to take in all the land of the Palestinians. That leaves millions of Muslims angry, and moderate Muslims in despair, because they feel let down by nation states and the United Nations. As we know, an additional minority will resort to terrorism. Military action against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will be a principal recruiting sergeant for terrorism, and al-Qaeda will be delighted if the United States and Britain go to war.</p> <p pid=".311.0/11">There are also wider consequences: the threat to the fragile world economy, and a boost to the right-wing United States unilateralists, who think that the new world order should consist of them issuing the orders. The rest of the world will, in future, be waiting nervously to see who will be the next target for such treatment.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".313.2/1">I should make it clear at the outset that my hon. Friends and I will support the Government in the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a> Lobby this evening. The Government have said that this motion is not a vote for war, but we are under no illusion about the fact that it is a further step along a route that might end in war. We do not support such a motion lightly, therefore, because we are well aware of the consequences that might flow from it. Indeed, all right hon. and hon. Members will be deeply conscious of the fact that thousands of servicemen are on their way to the Gulf, and we know what the consequences for them may be. I remark parenthetically that among those going to the Gulf are the two Irish regiments: the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Irish_Regiment">Royal Irish Regiment</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Guards">Irish Guards</a>. Consequently, well in excess of 1,000 people from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>—and, indeed, a not insignificant number from the Republic of Ireland—will shortly be deployed in the Gulf.</p> <p pid=".313.2/2">Time is pressing, and I want to make just a few short and simple points. We have no doubt about the nature of the regime in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. I was amazed at the comment by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=903" title="Our page on George Galloway - &#39;the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvin (Mr. Galloway)&#39;">Mr. Galloway</a>, who referred to Texas as the execution chamber of the world. Does he know nothing about <span class="hi">Iraq</span>? Does he know nothing about what has happened in Baghdad in the past 30 years? That was an appalling statement for him to make, and he needs to look at the regime that he has befriended a little more clearly.</p> <p pid=".313.2/3">We have no doubt about the threat, about the wars that have been started, or about the weapons of mass destruction that have been accumulated, and which continue to be there. There is also no doubt about what the United Nations requires. There are United Nations resolutions that require <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> to disarm. There has certainly been a failure to comply. There was a material breach before 1441, and there is a material breach now.</p> <p pid=".313.2/4">What should we do? That is the question. It is only the credible threat of force that has achieved the little progress that there has been, and that has made Saddam Hussein permit the admission of inspectors. That comes after the failure of earlier UN resolutions. All the resolutions in the 1990s failed. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> and the world community allowed themselves to be bluffed and manoeuvred out of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Against that background, 1441 had to be clear, and backed up by a credible threat of force. That credible threat has to be maintained.</p> <p pid=".313.2/5">The paradox is that, in order to obtain compliance with UN resolutions, there has to be the threat of force. Unless Saddam Hussein complies, it is inevitable that that force will have to be used. The time involved may be long or short, but hon. Members who have supported the UN and its resolutions, including 1441, must be aware that, as a consequence, they must support the credible use of force, right down to the point of its use. If they fail to do so, they will weaken the UN gravely.</p> <p pid=".313.2/6">The UN has been weakened badly enough by the failures of the 1990s. It has again set its hand to trying to carry through its will in this matter, and it must succeed. If not, enormous damage will be done to the possibility that the UN can be credible in the future, and that will have implications for world peace. The paradox is that those who want peace and a UN that succeeds in the world must therefore support the Government, right down to the use of force if that becomes necessary.</p> <p pid=".313.2/7">I appreciate that some people find that difficult to live with. Some of those who are reluctant to go down the route that I have described are well meaning, and others are engaged in wishful thinking. We have seen some evidence of that in the debate.</p> <p pid=".313.2/8">Other people are influenced by less noble motives. I have been distressed by the degree of anti-Americanism that has been expressed in the debate, and the personal hostility to the President. I consider that wholly misplaced. I have been appalled at some of the comments about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>, and at the false caricature of him that has been presented. I base that opinion not only on the fleeting personal acquaintance that I have had with him, but on what he has said and done over the past couple of years, which I have looked at closely.</p> <p pid=".313.2/9">The record is clear, especially in the period since <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> has moved slowly, deliberately and proportionately. That is the evidence of the past year and a half. I have listened to the caricatures of President Bush that have been presented, and I think that hon. Members should get away from the propaganda—coming from elements in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Democrat">American Democrat</a> party—that they have swallowed. They should look at things a little more clearly.</p> <p pid=".313.2/10">People have been concerned about what will happen in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and the region if force has to be used. However, we must realise that the region is highly unstable. That is another of the lessons of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>: it brought home to us just how unstable the region is. We need to think about the causes of that instability, and about how we can resolve or do something to improve the situation there.</p> <p pid=".313.2/11">This is a complex issue, and I cannot go far into it in the couple of minutes remaining to me, but we need to ask ourselves what we can do about it. If there were no oil in the region, there would be a series of failed states there. The region has failed to deal with the challenge of modernisation.</p> <p pid=".313.2/12">I emphasise that I am talking about the middle east region as a whole and the Arab states there, not about Islam. A distinction must be drawn between Islam and what is happening in the middle east in respect of a particular and virulent strand of that religion. That strand is a distortion of Islam.</p> <p pid=".313.2/13">We need to ask why modernisation has failed. Saddam grew out of the Ba'ath socialist party, although he is, in fact, a crude anti-Semitic nationalist. Why have such people obtained and retained power? How do we change that?</p> <p pid=".313.2/14">I am not just talking about regime change, but asking how we change the culture in the middle east and the orientation of those states because, until we do that, we will not achieve stability. Just talking about the problem in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_Palestine">Israel and Palestine</a> is not terribly helpful. That problem cannot be dealt with in isolation. It is part of the instability generally, and dealing with that instability generally will make it easier to deal with Israel and Palestine; but we cannot deal with that in isolation.</p> <p pid=".313.2/15">The issue this evening is whether we support the Government in what they are doing—whether we want the UN resolutions to be enforced. That is the challenge. The resolutions have got to be complied with or enforced—if not complied with, then enforced—and that has to be done as and when we can to maintain the threat, and it may have to be done soon.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".315.0/1">Most people would agree that war can be justified only when all other options have been exhausted, and it is my view that we have not reached that point. There is still an alternative to war: the weapons inspection process, set in place by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> resolution 1441 last November.</p> <p pid=".315.0/2">Dr. Blix made the point—as did the Liberal Democrat spokesman earlier—that there have been eight years of inspections since 1991, followed by a four-year gap, and that there have now been inspections for just so many weeks. As Dr. Blix says, with characteristic understatement, to call it a day after just 13 weeks is a little short. It is indeed; I would go further and say that it is wrong.</p> <p pid=".315.0/3">During his statement to the House earlier this month on contingency preparations, I suggested to the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence that the threat to world security from <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is less while the weapons inspectors are in place. In many ways, my views have been strengthened by the reports of Dr. Blix and Dr. el-Baradei.</p> <p pid=".315.0/4">In essence, as the House is aware, Dr. Blix is largely positive about what he calls <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> co-operation on process, but he has identified shortcomings in <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> co-operation on substance. In that respect, the tone of his report of <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-14">14 February</phrase> was significantly more optimistic than that of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January</phrase>. As Dr. Blix told <i>Time</i> magazine, if the reality changes, he has to register that to reflect the potential opportunity for progress that has opened up.</p> <p pid=".315.0/5">The truth is that the weapons inspections process has far from outlived its usefulness. Weapons inspections are still a viable alternative to military action, and the process should be pursued until either it is concluded successfully or it is clear that the inspections cannot usefully continue.</p> <p pid=".315.0/6">As an aside, I would make a point in response to the argument that inspections have taken place for 12 years. After all, it is legitimate to ask what has happened during those 12 years. Has <span class="hi">Iraq</span> attacked, or threatened to attack, its neighbours or the wider world? When we talk about those 12 years, we should not pretend that they were 12 years of total failure. From an international viewpoint, there was the effective containment of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, and containment in those circumstances is not necessarily a bad policy.</p> <p pid=".315.0/7">I do not want the House to misunderstand me; it is clear that Saddam Hussein is brutal dictator. I am not advocating that the status quo should exist in perpetuity, and we must deal with <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> weapons of mass destruction.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".316.1/1">We are in broad agreement that, certainly, the inspections process should not be concluded at this point.</p> <p pid=".316.1/2">Turning to the future, I am not in a position to assess the strength of <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> that the Iraqi regime can mount against the military might of the US, supported by Britain and any other states that might fight alongside us. But regardless of the intensity and duration of a war in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, it would not be surprising if sustaining a new regime within a framework acceptable to the victors was far more demanding in terms of resources and what could be achieved politically. Reports of the plans for <span class="hi">Iraq</span> after military action show the scale of what we have in mind.</p> <p pid=".316.1/3">Neither would I want to guess what support there is for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> in Iraq—possibly the vast <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> will welcome his overthrow—but it is certainly true that many people in the wider world will deeply resent a military attack, especially if it is not explicitly authorised by the UN. A leading figure in the international Muslim community who was visiting Edinburgh last year told me that an attack on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will be seen by many Muslims throughout the world as an attack on a second Muslim country after Afghanistan. It would certainly not be a surprise if the new regime in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> were a target for Muslim radicals throughout the world.</p> <p pid=".316.1/4">More broadly, without a second resolution we can be confident that war on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> would be detrimental to the international coalition against terrorism that has been built up since <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>. Some states that are now co-operating would reduce or even cease their involvement. Some individuals who are currently co-operating with the police and the security services, or who have the potential to do so, would be discouraged from doing so. As has been pointed out, a bloody war in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> could be a factor in encouraging more young Muslims to adopt a misguided and radical approach and to support and participate in terrorist acts.</p> <p pid=".316.1/5">What are the options before us? We can all agree that the most desirable outcome is full Iraqi co-operation with weapons inspectors and the peaceful dismantling of <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> weapons of mass destruction. That would be a victory for the United Nations and for the stance taken by the United States and our <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. A second scenario is military action that is not endorsed by the United Nations. Some may say that resolution 1441 gives authority for military action, and if <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is in breach, any resulting military action can be described as being authorised by the UN. However, France, China and Russia made it clear when that resolution was passed that they did not consider their support for the resolution as constituting endorsement of future military action. Given the views of those three states, the realpolitik is that an attack on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will be seen by the world as authorised by the international community only if it is backed by a further resolution from the United Nations. If military action is clearly endorsed by the UN, I imagine that most Labour Members will go along with it. While many people worldwide would resent the attack, explicit authorisation by the UN would reduce the scale of opposition.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".317.2/1">This may be the last opportunity to vote on a substantive motion before British forces are committed to war. If so, those of us who disagree with a war policy will find it much more difficult to express our views. It is therefore important that we take advantage of this debate to do so.</p> <p pid=".317.2/2"><a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1289" title="Our page on David Trimble - &#39;The right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble)&#39;">Mr. Trimble</a> has spoken about anti-Americanism, which troubles me, too. I am disturbed by the fact that I cannot support the American position on this matter. I have always attached huge importance to the relationship with the United States. I have long-standing and close relations with that country. I am bound to say, however, that I believe it to be wrong on this matter. I understand the American position, which is not crude or unworthy of respect. It is not about oil or about completing what a previous President left undone; in fact, I think that he was right to stop the Gulf war when he did in 1991. This is different.</p> <p pid=".317.2/3">Since <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, the United States has developed a different sense of vulnerability. In the context of that sense of vulnerability, it has developed the philosophy of a pre-emptive strike against those who may pose a threat to its security. I understand that. I happen to think that it is wrong, but it is not an unworthy attitude. At the same time, I also have a great deal of respect and understanding for the position of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. In that regard, I agree with much that my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=820" title="Our page on Patrick Cormack - &#39;the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)&#39;">Sir Patrick Cormack</a> said. It is right that we should stand by our allies; after all, we expect them to stand by us. However, we need to keep in mind the fact that the United States is the one country capable of taking unilateral action. It is therefore all the more important that we should bind the United States into the multinational organisations that try to regulate the world.</p> <p pid=".317.2/4">War is wrong. I want to explain my reasons for saying that in four brief ways. First, a Security Council resolution is highly desirable, but it does not make what otherwise is wrong, right. It may provide legal cover, to use the phraseology of my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=697" title="Our page on Michael Ancram - &#39;the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)&#39;">Mr. Ancram</a>, but that is not sufficient.</p> <p pid=".317.2/5">Secondly, I am deeply troubled by the morality of what we are about to do. Here I find myself adopting the language—although perhaps less eloquently—of my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=929" title="Our page on John Gummer - &#39;the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)&#39;">Mr. Gummer</a>. As we were reminded by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1232" title="Our page on Chris Smith - &#39;the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith)&#39;">Mr. Smith</a>, war involves injury and death—maybe of thousands—and the devastation of a country. We really must not do that unless all other policy options are closed. Above all, we must not do that unless we can properly invoke the doctrine of self-defence. I accept that the doctrine of self-defence has to be given an enlarged meaning: one does not wait until one is attacked. However, one must be able to say that the risk to one's own country, to the country of one's friends and allies, or to the world is imminent and grave. In all conscience, I do not think that we can say that about <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. The policy of deterrence has worked these past 12 years and I believe that it will continue to work in future. I am therefore not satisfied as to the morality of our action.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".319.1/1">In 1991, I stood at the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you&#39;ve ever seen inside the Commons, you&#39;ll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> and described what I had seen on the mountains of Iran and <span class="hi">Iraq</span> when the Kurds fled from the bombardment of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. I am afraid that people have very short memories. The scenes were appalling and typical of the attacks made by the Iraqi regime on its own people. The victims include Arabs as well as Kurds. They also include Assyrians, Turkomans and the Shi'as in the south of the country who were forced to flee from the marshes into Iran.</p> <p pid=".319.1/2">I have spent the past two days travelling and I have come back for this debate so that I can tell the House what I have seen and heard. As the House knows, I have continually argued the case over the years for indicting the regime for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. I am grateful to 201 of my colleagues on both sides of the House who supported my proposal. I believe that the regime should be removed and that it could have been removed by using international law and indictment. It is a great regret to me that this country, which could have led the way, did not do so. After two years of our making the case and providing evidence from the victims of the regime, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> felt that there was not sufficient evidence. I do not know how much evidence one needs, because it abounds. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">Amnesty International</a> have the evidence, and the Kurds captured documents from the torture centre that they eventually liberated. Thousands of their citizens died there.</p> <p pid=".319.1/3">On my latest visit, I opened the first genocide museum in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. It was snowing and quite dark on that day and people had come from all over the area. Their relatives had died in that torture chamber. Inside the museum were photographs that the Kurds had taken. The images were of skulls and shreds of clothing, and of the type of thing that one sees in genocide museums elsewhere in the world. I have been to similar museums in Rwanda and Cambodia, and I have seen the holocaust exhibition in London, but I am afraid that, on this occasion, I just cried. I do not think that I have ever cried in public before, but I did so because the regime's victims were all around me. One old woman came up to me with a piece of plastic and pushed it into my hand. I unwrapped it and saw three photographs. They were of her husband and two sons who had died in that torture centre.</p> <p pid=".319.1/4">People had written things on the cell walls. Sometimes the writing was in blood and sometimes it was just marks to cross off the days of the week. Inside one cell is a statue of a Peshmerga, whose face looks upward towards a grill through which the light comes. I was told that that Peshmerga had died in that cell and that he was always looking towards the light, because he hoped that, one day, he would be out in the daylight again.</p> <p pid=".319.1/5">The victims were all around me, and I have been involved for 25 years—including before I became a politician—with the Iraqi opposition. For those 25 years, I have heard the tales of Saddam Hussein's regime and its repression of the Kurds and other minorities. People seem to think that that all came to an end in 1991, but that is a big mistake. Repression, torture and ethnic cleansing have continued throughout the time since then.</p> <p pid=".319.1/6">On my latest visit, I met some of the victims of torture who had, in the past few months, come out of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib">Abu Ghraib</a> prison in Baghdad under the so-called amnesty. One man told me stories that I hardly like to repeat, but we at Indict have taken victims' statements over the past seven years. This victim was a youngish man who said that he had been in prison for eight years. He said that almost every day, people were executed at that prison—not one person, but hundreds. When there was an attack on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uday_Hussein">Uday Hussein</a>'s life some time ago, 2,000 prisoners in the prison were executed on the same day. That is the reality of Saddam's <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. When I hear people calling for more time, I say "Who will speak up for those victims?"</p> <p pid=".319.1/7">I shall recount only two stories told by the same man. He told me that a university professor gave birth at the Abu Ghraib prison while he was there. Apparently, because of the very poor diet of thin soup and bread, she did not have enough milk to feed the baby when it was born. She begged the guards for milk, but they refused to give it and the baby died. She held that baby in her arms for three days and would not give up the body. At the end of the three days, because the temperature in the prison was very hot—some 60° C—the body began to smell. They took the woman and her dead baby away. I asked the former prisoner what happened to her and he said that she was killed.</p> <p pid=".319.1/8">The man then talked about a young boy aged 15 who had done something or other and was in the prison, and fainted during one of the torture sessions—he was beaten so hard that he fainted. The guards pinned him up to the frame of a window and crucified him on the window frame while he was still alive. When he came to, he was crying out for water, but nobody would give him water. One of the other prisoners threw water in his face, but that prisoner was himself taken away and beaten.</p> <p pid=".319.1/9">Ethnic cleansing goes on all the time. I visited a UN camp where there were hundreds of recent victims of ethnic cleansing who had been kicked out of Kirkuk. The men, women and little children in the camp had been told that they had 24 hours to get out of Kirkuk because they would not agree that they were not Kurds, but Arabs, as part of Arabisation. In other countries, we have taken action against people responsible for ethnic cleansing, so I say to my colleagues, please, who is to help the victims of Saddam Hussein's regime unless we do?</p> <p pid=".319.1/10">I believe in regime change. I say that without hesitation, and I will support the Government tonight because I think that they are doing a brave thing.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".321.0/1">No one would doubt the sincerity and long-standing commitment of <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a> to the Kurdish people. I only wish that I could believe that many of those who are planning military action have the same sincere concern about the hopes and aspirations of the Kurdish people. Although I oppose military action, as I am about to outline, I hope that the question of Turkish deployment in the Kurdish areas is well understood by the people who are planning military action, as well as the consequences that might follow.</p> <p pid=".321.0/2">There is one point on which I agree with <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=903" title="Our page on George Galloway - &#39;the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvin (Mr. Galloway)&#39;">Mr. Galloway</a> and one on which I disagree with him strongly. The point of agreement is that, without any question, people should understand that this debate is going to be the crucial one as far as war is concerned. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said—perhaps this admission would not have been made by the Foreign Secretary—that the resolution before the United Nations and the Government motion are cover resolutions. That is how he described them. I took that to mean that although they do not mention war or military action—even the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> resolution at the Security Council does not do that and the Government's motion certainly does not do so—if they were passed at the Security Council and here, they would be taken as a green light for military action. No one who votes or does not vote tonight should be under any illusions that this is the opportunity to slow down the process if people want to do that. If that opportunity is not taken, it ain't going to come again.</p> <p pid=".321.0/3">There is another reason for that which we should understand as well. The procedures of <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> do not always allow for the sort of vote that we are fortunate to have this evening. Not for the first time in his fairly short time as <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, our Speaker has taken an unusual course in selecting a genuine all-party <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that gives hon. Members a chance to vote on an issue of principle that goes across the parties. I am proud to speak for my party and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> in supporting and co-sponsoring the amendment tabled by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1232" title="Our page on Chris Smith - &#39;the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith)&#39;">Mr. Smith</a>. That type of amendment will not necessarily be allowed to emerge again under our procedures, so let us make no mistake—this is the opportunity for hon. Members who wish to do so to vote to slow up the march to war.</p> <p pid=".321.0/4">The hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvin said some fairly savage things about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>. I do not agree. I can understand that view in terms of the policy of the American Administration, but I tend to look at the matter slightly differently. I see that <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=838" title="Our page on Tam Dalyell - &#39;the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell)&#39;">Mr. Dalyell</a> is looking puzzled. He is probably the only Member who was a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a> ran for President of the United States in 1964. He ran under the argument that America could win a pre-emptive war against the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> if it was strong enough in nuclear weapons. His slogan was, "In your heart, you know he's right". <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Democrat">The Democrat</a> reply was, "In your guts, you know he's nuts". Thankfully for all of us, the Democrats were successful in that election. I am not arguing that that is President Bush's position, but when I listen to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Perle">Richard Perle</a> and other people who are central to that Administration, the words of the Democrat party in 1964 are very meaningful to me—in my guts I think they are nuts. They are trying to apply a management school theory about dominating companies and markets to international politics. They argue that America must exert its power in every sphere of influence, regardless of any consequences. That argument, which would have been regarded as extremism only a few years ago, now holds sway in key parts of the American Administration.</p> <p pid=".321.0/5">I differ with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvin on the reason why that argument is central to the Administration. It is due not to a deep-laid plot by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W">George W</a>. Bush, but to the consequences of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> and the trauma and fear that has gripped the American people since then. This is not anti-Americanism. America is a country that was founded out of the intellectual strength of the Scottish enlightenment. <i>[Laughter.]</i> I hear some laughs. Hon. Members on both sides of the House should understand where the American constitution and its checks and balances came from. America understands it. The founding fathers would be birling in their graves, to use a Scottish phrase, if they could see what is being done in the name of America and the American constitution in terms of the pre-emptive, aggressive policy that is emanating from the American Administration. It is possible for that policy to become central to the Administration only in an atmosphere of fear.</p> <p pid=".321.0/6">That is where the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> is heavily culpable. As the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury told the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> yesterday in a telling <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, it is the job of a candid friend to tell his friend the truth in times of crisis. That is particularly so in this case given that the friend, America, is gripped in the trauma of the aftermath of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, 18 months ago. The fact that the Prime Minister has failed to do that is his central culpability, because he was in a position to put the brakes on that sort of policy, and he still is in such a position. Unfortunately, however, he has exchanged that position of influence to become a prisoner of the policies that emanate from some of the extreme people in the American Administration. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister is no longer in charge of these events and that events are controlling him. To return to the "Newsnight" interview that I mentioned earlier in an exchange with the Foreign Secretary, the Prime Minister was specific in front of a studio audience about there being one set of circumstances, and one only, in which he would argue for the use of force.</p> <p pid=".321.0/7">That was if the weapons inspectors said that their process had ended. According to the transcript, the Prime Minister said that if the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the Security Council adopted a second resolution and it was blocked by one country's unreasonable veto, he would consider the use of force. It is significant that neither the Prime Minister yesterday nor the Foreign Secretary today was prepared to stand even on that position. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> is no longer in control of events; they are controlling him.</p> <p pid=".321.0/8">Let us consider morality. The Prime Minister is a religious man and I respect that. It does him great credit. I have nothing like his record of church going or observance. However, I, too, have faith and conviction. I believe that if an immoral and unjust war takes place, with thousands of casualties and the spilling of innocent blood, the person responsible for arguing for it will answer one day to a much higher authority than the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".323.0/1">All hon. Members know that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> is an evil man. He is a brutal dictator who has committed genocide and used poison gas against his people. He launched a war against Iran that resulted in more than <span class="hi">1</span> million people being killed. He invaded Kuwait and, when he left, caused an environmental disaster by torching the oilfields. I have no doubt that he has weapons of mass destruction and I fully accept that he has not complied with United Nations resolutions. With the rest of the civilised world, I believe that the Iraqi people would be well rid of such a person.</p> <p pid=".323.0/2">However, do my comments explain the reasons for America and the United Kingdom making a pre-emptive strike? I regret to say that I am not convinced. I fully support working through the UN, although I can envisage circumstances in which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, the United Kingdom or any other country took unilateral action, for example, if they perceived their national interest to be under threat. After 9/11, the civilised world united in its determination to combat and root out international terrorism. We rightly identified al-Qaeda as the main proponent and rightly took action against the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_in_Afghanistan">Taliban in Afghanistan</a> because they were harbouring that organisation.</p> <p pid=".323.0/3">Since our action in Afghanistan, we have realised that we failed to obliterate al-Qaeda, and America appears to have lost the plot. Instead of pursuing terrorists, who live in the shadows and kill indiscriminately in the shopping malls of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> and the bars of Bali, we are seeking a change of Government in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> on the basis that Saddam Hussein is an evil man who will not comply fully with UN resolutions. That is an unconvincing justification for a dangerous course of action.</p> <p pid=".323.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> referred to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a> and Iran as the axis of evil. What will we do about North Korea, which is ruled by an equally ruthless dictator and also has weapons of mass destruction? Everybody knows that the Chinese will not allow the Americans to interfere in North Korea's affairs. What will we do about Iran?</p> <p pid=".323.0/5">As I have said previously, 50 per cent. of the electorate in my <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> are Muslims. My support for the American ethos and my belief that, overall, America has been more a force for good than evil in the world does not always win me great support among my Muslim constituents. However, I must tell my many friends in America that I believe that they are about to make a disastrous mistake. With great respect to them, I do not believe that they understand the Islamic world. The current American Administration does not appreciate the consequences in the Muslim world of a pre-emptive strike on <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. If America, supported by the United Kingdom, launches a pre-emptive strike against <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, Saddam Hussein will overnight become a hero—a martyr—of the Muslim world despite the fact that he is not a hero now because he runs a secularist rather than a fundamentalist regime.</p> <p pid=".323.0/6">What will be the consequences in adjoining countries? We need to remember that bin Laden comes from the Saudi royal family. He left <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> to form the al-Qaeda organisation because he believed that the house of Saud was giving America too much support by allowing it to have bases in a country that is home to the great places of worship for all Muslims. What will happen if a regime change takes place in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and the house of Saud comes under attack from within its own country? Will America commit itself to stationing a large number of troops, for however many years, in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and Saudi Arabia? If so, what will that do to opinion in the Muslim world? What will happen to the Mubarak regime in Egypt? I accept that it is not a pleasant regime, but it is pro-western and greatly vulnerable to attack from within. What will happen to that country?</p> <p pid=".323.0/7">I strongly support the war against international terrorism, but America, Britain and the rest of the western world would be well advised to give more attention to why international terrorists emerge. They do not suddenly come out of the sky. International terrorists are born in the squalid, teeming refugee camps of Gaza, the west bank and along the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad-Kashmir">Azad-Kashmir</a> border. Young people living in those camps are without a country, a job, a future or any hope. They are vulnerable recruits for those people who say, "You will get your reward in the next world. Just join us in the jihad against America and the west." They will join having been told that America pursues double standards and that, when convenient, will use UN resolutions to justify a pre-emptive strike against <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. They will also be told that when, I regret to say, it suits America and other countries in the west, a blind eye is turned to UN resolutions on the building of settlements by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Government">Israeli Government</a> all over the west bank and on India not carrying out a plebiscite to allow the people of Kashmir to determine their own future.</p> <p pid=".323.0/8">I am not by nature a rebel. It gives me no pleasure to say that I cannot support my Government in the Lobby tonight. I am proud of the enormous amount that they have achieved since coming to power. I do not support or have any love for Saddam Hussein. I want the man to go and to go soon. But—</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".324.1/1">Politicians are often accused of being out of touch with the electorate, but I have never felt so much at one with the ordinary man and woman on the street as I felt when we marched together as part of the <span class="hi">1</span> million who took to the streets on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-15">15 February</phrase>. Many had been moved to participate in a march for the first time in their lives. Others, like myself, who had been on many marches for a variety of reasons over many years, noticed something very different with that march. It was not only the sheer volume of people who took to the streets or the fact they came from all walks of life, but the strength of their plea to be heard. They wanted the Government to listen to their views. To see a young mother from my <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> with her young child summed up for me how the protest had moved individuals in a way that I had never witnessed before.</p> <p pid=".324.1/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_House">This House</a> must show that it is listening to the people of Britain: listening to their concerns, their fears and their hope that a peaceful solution can be found rather than our engaging in war. A war with <span class="hi">Iraq</span> could well escalate into a much wider regional conflict, and will surely result in increased terrorist activities in this country, in the United States and elsewhere in the world.</p> <p pid=".324.1/3">Many who were on the march, and many in the House, believe that the case for war has not yet been proved, that the inspectors should be given more time, and that all other options have not been exhausted. War must always be a last resort. Today's debate may be our last chance to register our concerns in the House before military action starts, and I want to record my view that the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and George Bush are wrong. The Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> may well believe absolutely in what he says, but he has not convinced me, he has not convinced many other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a>, and he has not convinced the vast <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of people out there in the country.</p> <p pid=".324.1/4">I have been contacted by hundreds of constituents by post, e-mail and telephone. To a man and to a woman, they say that they do not believe a case has been made for going to war. I have no doubt that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> must be disarmed and I would not absolutely rule out the use of force, but, after four years without weapons inspectors, to say that after 11 weeks we must call it a day and go to war is wrong. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> and the inspectors should have all the time they need. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> is not united. One reason is that the pace is being forced by the British and American Governments. Strong-arm tactics and financial inducements will not strengthen any second resolution; they will weaken it.</p> <p pid=".324.1/5">George Bush has made clear that if there is no second resolution, he will take action anyway. That has left many feeling that the decision has already been made, and that what is happening now is just covering up for the fact that the final troop deployments are not yet in place. Negotiations with Turkey are in their final stages, and today we have heard of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF">RAF</a> jets stuck in Cyprus. The final pieces of the military jigsaw are not yet in place, but they will be in a few weeks, and that is when many expect military action to start.</p> <p pid=".324.1/6">While other nations are pushing for peace and putting their energy into trying to make the inspections work, what we are seeing from our Government is a push for war, not a push for peace. Recently we have heard much about the moral case for war and the suffering of the Iraqi people—the number who have died over the years during which Saddam has been in power—but the moral case is seriously weakened by the fact that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has obtained deadly pathogens from France, the United States and Germany, including anthrax, gas gangrene and west Nile fever.</p> <p pid=".324.1/7">What happens when the war is over? Who is in the frame for any future administration? Included in the list of potential leading lights in the regime to follow the toppling of Saddam Hussein are people who would make the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butcher_of_Baghdad">Butcher of Baghdad</a> look good. According to an article in the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Herald">Sunday Herald</a></i>, they include General Nizar Al-Khazraji, who is suspected of leading the chemical attack that killed 5,000 Kurds in Halabja in 1988, and who is alleged by some eyewitnesses to have kicked a Kurdish child to death during the height of Iraqi repression in that year.</p> <p pid=".324.1/8">The danger of any military action spreading throughout the region is another reason to avoid all-out war if at all possible. If Saddam can involve other countries in any conflict, he will; and the double standards that have been applied to Israel will become even more obvious as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Government">Israeli Government</a> continue actions that, were they taking place in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, would have justified military action for many.</p> <p pid=".324.1/9">There has been talk of Saddam Hussein's going into exile, but if he went into exile in, say, Sudan, would that not be used as a legitimate reason to take action against that country for harbouring him and, possibly, terrorists? <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;The hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a> made a very emotional speech. I agree that if Saddam is toppled he should go on trial, not into a life of luxury.</p> <p pid=".324.1/10">Saddam's past history has been cited as a reason for taking action now, but many countries—some of which are now our strongest allies—have been at war with us in the past. While a recent past record is important, it is not reason enough to go to war. The war on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is also constantly linked to the war on terrorism. I ask, where is the link? Where is the evidence?</p> <p pid=".324.1/11">Before we go to war, any Government should have the support of the people and the support of their representatives. Today they will see what their representatives think, but tomorrow we should be aware that the people outside are still not convinced.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".326.0/1">For me, one of the most powerful passages in the United Nations charter is not in the detail of any of its chapters but in its opening preamble:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".326.0/2">"We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind".</p> <p pid=".326.0/3">The preamble did not seek a pretext for other wars, and did not seek to justify a little ritual slaughter when the mood took us. It was a declaration by the international community at the end of the second world war that we had to pursue a path where the avoidance of war and its human consequences had to be a global priority.</p> <p pid=".326.0/4">Against that background, I regard today's motion and the war rhetoric surrounding it as a low point in contemporary British politics. They mark the disconnection of the House from the society we claim to represent. The realities of the wider world are clear—the case for a war against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> remains unproven. I shall therefore vote for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, and against the motion. We should look at the sorry state of our current Parliament. Increasingly, we appear to have a Government who are looking for a pretext for war, rather than its avoidance. We appear to produce dossiers of mass deception, whose claims are dismissed as risible almost as soon as they are released. We have the embarrassment of a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> whose arguments chase from one discredited case to another in the search for something that will convince the public of the case for a war in which they do not believe. If anything slightly relieves the pain for Labour it is the condition of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a>, whose members appear to have given up the will to live and believe that they can only be redeemed if they offer to bomb earlier and more often. That is not, however, the position of the overwhelming <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the British public.</p> <p pid=".326.0/5">I have just returned from a visit to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_Canada">United States and Canada</a>, where I was part of a citizens weapons inspectorate. We went to the Edgewood research base just outside Washington, where we attempted to ask its personnel for rights of access to inspect the site and for an account of the weapons of mass destruction that they were working on. They openly acknowledged working on anthrax, plague, botulinum, ricin and cholera. If such weapons were found in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, they would immediately become the basis on which <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> would declare war.</p></div>

That is a measure of discrepancies, if not hypocrisy, in our approach to the role and rights of inspections as a way of stabilising and securing international confidence in the removal of weapons of mass destruction.

Perhaps the most frightening thing for me was not the stark openness of that work but the attitude of the pro-war protesters who followed the inspectors round. Their banners and slogans said much about the popular culture created largely at the behest of the American Administration and the American press. "We tried to give peace a chance and got 9/11," said one. Another said, "Give war a chance." Perhaps the most frightening of all said, "Today <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, tomorrow France."</p> <p pid=".327.1/3">Those were measures of the visceral feelings of gung-ho militarism that characterise the debate taking place in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>. We ought to think carefully before wandering even partially down that path. Those are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>'s people, who stood up following the last report of the weapons inspectors and said that the objections made by a succession of countries that did not accept that a convincing case had been made for war were not objections in principle, but the objections of countries holding out for a bigger bribe. It is clear that the US view of the UN is that it is simply a body to be bought or bypassed.</p> <p pid=".327.1/4">Our view must identify with the 30 million people worldwide who say no, war is not the answer, nor is it acceptable. It is not justified in the current circumstances and it would be a horrendous gift to one group and one group only: al-Qaeda. From the evidence of the past 50 years, we know that containment works and inspection works. That is the basis on which the United Nations has worked at its best. We ought not to dismiss the value of that work.</p> <p pid=".327.1/5">In relation to <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, have we found weapons of mass destruction that threaten to destroy the west? No. Have we had any threat from <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to destroy the west? No. In those circumstances, we should listen to our other allies in the United Nations—to Germany, France, Russia and perhaps to China—and to the inspectors. Their claims for more time, rather than more troops, are the voices that we should hear. We need inspections, not invasions.</p> <p pid=".327.1/6">The west and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> must find the courage to speak out in favour of the peaceful settlement of international conflict and tension, rather than the presumption that we can drift into a war that would do nothing but scar the entire century. We owe a duty to our children and our society to find the courage to ally ourselves with those whose voices urge a peaceful solution to the issue, not a descent into warmongering.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".328.0/1">Understandably, we have heard a great deal this afternoon about the military campaign. In the few minutes available to me, I shall say a few words about the humanitarian campaign. In a statement to the House a few days ago, the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said that there needs to be</p> <p class="indent" pid=".328.0/2">"a humanitarian plan that is every bit as viable and well worked out as a military plan."—[<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pop=1&amp;s=date:20030203+column:36+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, <span class="hi">3</span> February 2003; Vol. 399, c. 36</a>.]</p> <p pid=".328.0/3"><i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist">The Economist</a></i> recently observed that many aspects of war hanging over <span class="hi">Iraq</span> are unpredictable, but one is not—the unusual vulnerability of the civilian population. There are two reasons for that. First, about 60 per cent. of the population, or 16 million people, are 100 per cent. dependent on central Government for basic needs. They survive only because the Government of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> provides them with a food ration each month. Secondly, after two wars, decades of mismanagement and 12 years of exacting sanctions, there is no fat to rely on.</p> <p pid=".328.0/4">It is therefore essential not to see the military campaign and the humanitarian campaign in two separate boxes. As both Kosovo and Afghanistan have recently shown us, it cannot simply be a matter of fighting a military campaign, then announcing "end ex" and starting a humanitarian campaign the next day. Those planning military action must think about the humanitarian consequences of that action, not least how to minimise the impact of conflict on civilians. I emphasise that that is particularly important in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, where huge numbers of people live in abject poverty, many families are clinging on by their fingertips, and 60 per cent. of the population is dependent on the UN oil for food programme.</p> <p pid=".328.0/5">Any attack on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> is bound to involve aerial bombing to take out military infrastructure. How confident can we be that military commanders will seek not to bomb hospitals, residential areas and vital energy sources? Targeting must take account of the vulnerability of the existing infrastructure and the weaknesses of the sanitation and water systems, for example. Every indication is that people in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> are just about scraping along, but any sustained disruption of sewerage systems or clean water supplies will almost certainly speedily result in disease, illness and death in large numbers in the civilian population. We have to ensure that everyone involved—the military in particular—thinks through the consequences for the men, women and children on the ground.</p> <p pid=".328.0/6">There are undoubtedly optimistic scenarios of what might happen, involving a short, well-targeted bombing campaign on key objectives, followed by a dash by coalition forces to seize Baghdad and Basra, the collapse of Iraqi resistance, the surrender of Iraqi troops and speedy regime change. It might be like that. It is to be hoped that any fighting—if, in due course, it comes to fighting—will be the shortest necessary to achieve the desired objectives. But history is littered with optimistic assessments that it would all be over in a matter of weeks by generals and politicians who then found themselves dug in for months or years. Military planners and humanitarian advisers have to plan for all scenarios, not just the most optimistic. I reiterate that any scenario will impact on a civilian population that is in poor shape anyway, and that any disruption of the oil-for-food programme will leave many people without the basic necessities of life. It is right that we should be cautious, because it was not easy to persuade the US military in Afghanistan to have regard to humanitarian considerations. Nine million people there were having to be fed by the World Food Programme before any military campaign began.</p> <p pid=".328.0/7">It is also important to reflect that this is all happening at a time when there are enormous strains on the international humanitarian system. When the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development">International Development</a> recently gave evidence on the humanitarian crisis in southern Africa to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a>, she expressed her concern that the scale of humanitarian feeding operations around the world was reaching such a level that she questioned whether the system could cope. Her concerns echoed identical points raised with the Committee only a little while ago by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Morris">James Morris</a>, the head of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_World_Food_Programme">UN World Food Programme</a>. Yesterday, the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Ethiopia gave evidence to the Select Committee. He made it clear that, notwithstanding recent generous commitments of food aid to Ethiopia—including those from the United Kingdom—unless further substantial amounts were provided by June, there would be a serious humanitarian situation in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa">Horn of Africa</a>.</p> <p pid=".328.0/8">So there are already monumental food aid requirements in the Horn of Africa, throughout southern Africa and in Afghanistan. It would, therefore, be difficult for the international community to take on a further substantial food programme. There are problems with the funding of the World Food Programme, with the supply of food, and with the capacity of institutions logistically to continue to manage a massive and ever-expanding programme. The political will to do so will also be much more difficult to achieve if the international community is divided. It will be difficult to get co-ordinated European Union action on humanitarian relief when some of the larger EU member states are at considerable variance with others as to the appropriate way forward on <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Countries such as France and Germany do not want to be seen to be preparing for the humanitarian campaign in a conflict to which they are opposed. If there is a conflict, it is essential that the oil-for-food programme continues to operate in the short and medium term.</p> <p pid=".328.0/9">What thought are our military commanders and political planners giving to the issue of refugees? In the last Gulf conflict, there were an estimated 1.8 million displaced people in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, out of a population of just over 26 million. Unlike in Afghanistan, most people in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> live in urban centres. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> estimates that there could be 900,000 refugees—100,000 in need of immediate assistance—and probably a further 500,000 displaced people in camps on the borders. It is impossible to predict just how many refugees there might be, because there are so many different potential scenarios. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> and the international community must plan for a range of possibilities and a range of numbers.</p> <p pid=".328.0/10">In addition to refugees, there will also be large numbers of internally displaced people in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. This prompts another important question. In Afghanistan, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a> appointed Mr. Brahimi as his personal representative. The co-ordination of the humanitarian effort in Afghanistan is clearly under the auspices of the UN and senior UN agencies answerable to an experienced co-ordinator appointed by and answerable to the UN Secretary-General. What is going to happen in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>? After any conflict, will the humanitarian effort be co-ordinated by the UN? Numerous, unattributable, press briefings would tend to suggest that the intention is for the President of the United States to appoint a senior general to run <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, post-conflict. That would be a mistake. Afghanistan has shown how difficult it is for humanitarian relief agencies to relate to and work with the military, when the military act in any other role than as clearly designated and approved UN peacekeepers—</p></div>

As a result, our world is a much smaller place than the world of the past. Therefore, we should recognise that we are in a stronger position to shape that world. As we enter this new century, our primary objective should be to make it the first century in the history of the world in which there is no war and no conflict.</p> <p pid=".330.1/2">Let us not forget that the victims of every war are the innocent civilians. Some 10 million were killed in the first world war and 40 million in the second world war. If innocent civilians are killed in a war against <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, their families will say, "Hussein is right and the terrorists are right. Those really are our enemies." We should be using our energies to create a peaceful and just world. If we use as much energy to do that as we would to fight a war, we would succeed far more quickly.</p> <p pid=".330.1/3">I ask Americans to remember the philosophies of their founding fathers. The ancestors of the present-day United States were driven from all their former countries by conflict, persecution, starvation and injustice. They decided that they did not want such things to happen in their new land—and we should remember the size of that land and how many states it has. What was their philosophy? It is one that the world needs again today and it is summed up on the American cent as "e pluribus unum". It is also writ large on the grave of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and it means that from many, we are one. The essence of our unity is respect for diversity. That is a message of real peace for the world, and I know that because of where I come from. We need respect for diversity and difference, because all conflict, no matter where it is, is about difference, be it of religion, race or nationality. The answer to difference is to respect it, because it is an accident of birth. We must get that message out.</p> <p pid=".330.1/4">Europe learned that lesson a while later than the United States. Who could have forecast, 50 years ago, during the worst century in the history of world, with two world wars—and 10 million killed in the first and 40 million killed in the second—that the peoples involved would gather together in a united Europe? But they have, and that is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution. Therefore, we should study how they did it and send that message to the world. The first principle of the European Union is exactly the same as that of the founding fathers of the United States—respect for difference and diversity—and it is backed up by institutions that respect difference and diversity, including the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a>, the Commission and the Parliament.</p> <p pid=".330.1/5">In the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a>, they work together in their common interests on areas of agreement rather than disagreement, on socio-economic development. They spill their sweat together, not their blood, and break down the barriers of centuries. That is a philosophy for the world. In today's smaller world, instead of sending soldiers, bombs and guns to kill human beings, we should send that philosophy. Because of the enormous influence of the United States and Britain in that smaller world, we could make a huge impact on it and create the first century in which there is no war and no conflict. If we used our energies to do that instead of in creating war, we would succeed far more quickly.</p></div>

Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume)&#39;">Mr. Hume</a> has just said. To suggest that the lesson of the second world war is that one should not go to war is to fly in the face of the real lesson of that war, which is that when faced with dictators one should deal with them sooner rather than later.</p> <p pid=".331.0/2">What we face is, as always, the problem of democracies when dealing with dictators. I subscribe to the paradox of freedom. The paradox of freedom, sometimes called the paradox of tolerance, is that one must tolerate all but the intolerant, because if one persists in tolerating the intolerant, then the tolerant will disappear, because the conditions for toleration will cease to exist.</p> <p pid=".331.0/3">Let me say on the question of weapons of mass destruction the following: <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has declared that it produced about 8,500 litres of anthrax, which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991. <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has provided little evidence for this production and no convincing evidence for its destruction. There are strong indications that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> produced more anthrax than it declared, and that at least some of this was retained after the declared destruction date. It might still exist. Either it should be found and be destroyed under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a> supervision, or else convincing evidence should be produced to show that it was, indeed, destroyed in 1991.</p> <p pid=".331.0/4">Those are not my words. They are the words of Dr. Blix in his report to the Security Council as recently as <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January</phrase> this year. They did not come from a dissertation. They did not come from a student thesis. They did not even come from a Government dossier. They are fact.</p> <p pid=".331.0/5">I was rather sad about the refusal by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1226" title="Our page on Alan Simpson - &#39;the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)&#39;">Alan Simpson</a>, who I am sorry to see has already vacated his place, to let me intervene when he was talking about the presence in north America of a biological plant, a plant that he said produces and deals with substances that are banned under the 1972 biological weapons convention. He compared that to the situation in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. I have interesting news for hon. Members. There is a plant like that in this country. It is called <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porton_Down">Porton Down</a>. Under the provisions of the 1972 biological weapons convention it does what such plants are allowed to do, which is to work on minuscule amounts of toxic substances in order to develop antidotes to them.</p></div>

That is why Saddam is in breach, and why we have to look very carefully at the recommendation that we should continue to give more time. The comparison is made between 11 weeks now and 12 years in the past. The fact is that during every conflict in which this country has engaged, one could have heard arguments analogous to those that we have heard today. Plenty of people argued that it was wrong to take action against the Nazis, until it became so late that the action that had to be taken proved much more costly than that which could have been taken earlier. Had such action been taken earlier, it would have been denounced as unwarranted and pre-emptive.</p></div>

Those who said, in advance of the action that was eventually taken against the Hitlerite regime, that no action was justified get a bad press, because they are now regarded as having had no reasonable arguments. Let me assure you, Mr. <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, that if we could revisit the debates that took place in this House in the 1930s, we would hear arguments for appeasement just as sophisticated as those put forward today. Those arguments were wrong then, and they are wrong now. It will be a grave mistake if people think that the cause of peace is served by always avoiding conflict. Sometimes, the only way to bring about peace is to face up to the need for conflict, and this is one of those occasions.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".333.8/1">We are now in a phoney peace. War drums are rolling, and I approach the next few weeks with a deep sense of foreboding, but also with a great deal of respect for those in my party and in the House generally—experts, former diplomats—who come to a different conclusion, including even my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=903" title="Our page on George Galloway - &#39;the Member for Glasgow, Kelvin (Mr. Galloway)&#39;">Mr. Galloway</a>, who made a passionate speech but offered not a scintilla of criticism of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>.</p> <p pid=".333.8/2">It is clear to me that the threat of force has indeed produced some results. The concessions made by Saddam Hussein just before the publication of Dr. Blix's report were predictable and, indeed, predicted. The fear is that a series of future benchmarks would equally lead to some grudging and minimal concessions, just before such reports were made. It is clear that force is the only language that Saddam Hussein understands, but there are many uncertainties. Different judgments will be made about the very grave cost-benefit analysis that has been made. I therefore view with respect those who take a different view. I am much less happy with those on either side of the argument who have absolutist convictions.</p> <p pid=".333.8/3">How did we get to this point? First, the pressure on Saddam Hussein did not begin on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-08">8 November</phrase> last year. He was defeated after he invaded Kuwait. There was a ceasefire resolution. He remains in breach of that resolution. Over the period of the 1990s, Saddam Hussein prevaricated, concealed, lied and obstructed the work of the inspectors.</p> <p pid=".333.8/4">I pose two critical questions. Why not give Saddam Hussein more time? Why act now?</p> <p pid=".333.8/5">The obvious retort to the first question is, time for what? If Dr. Blix asks for more time when he appears before the Security Council, in my judgment he should be given it. However, inspections will have limited relevance without proactive co-operation from the regime.</p> <p pid=".333.8/6">This is not a treasure hunt. The test is whether the Saddam Hussein regime is co-operating with the weapons inspectors. Resolution 1441 was wholly unambiguous. It required a complete declaration. Clearly, there were major gaps in the dossier produced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December</phrase>. Failure to comply and co-operate fully would be a further material breach.</p> <p pid=".333.8/7">There have been 12 years of diplomacy. It is 12 years to the day since Saddam Hussein ordered his troops to retreat from Kuwait. There have been years of inspection and sanctions. How long can that go on? Resolution 1441 talked of</p> <p class="indent" pid=".333.8/8">"immediate, unconditional and active co-operation".</p> <p pid=".333.8/9">Do any colleagues in the House believe that what has happened over the four months since 1441 was passed amounts to</p> <p class="indent" pid=".333.8/10">"immediate, unconditional and active co-operation"?</p> <p pid=".333.8/11">The second question that I posed was, why now? Clearly there is valid concern about extending the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defence. Its implications for international law are potentially very dangerous indeed. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> has been only too ready to push the doctrine to the limits. There has not been sufficient debate on the subject, but we have to accept that weapons of mass destruction pose new challenges that current international law does not meet.</p></div>

Equally, Saddam Hussein's hostility to the west means that there is a very serious danger that, at some time, he could pass chemical and biological weapons to terrorist networks.</p> <p pid=".334.1/3">Would any war be a just war? As a Christian, I welcome the contributions from the archbishops. It is right that they should draw our attention to just war principles, but that invites questions about their role. Those principles are there to make us think morally, but they have certain ambiguities. The archbishops acknowledge that those who must make the decisions have access to information that better enables them to answer questions such as, "Have all other options been exhausted? Will a war be effective?" In the final analysis, we are dealing not with absolutes but with judgments, based on the available facts, including intelligence facts.</p> <p pid=".334.1/4">Is war inevitable in the next few weeks? We have left Saddam Hussein a number of exit doors, and thus far he has refused to use them. The tempo of Dr. Blix is increasing. He has demanded that the missiles be destroyed. How will Saddam Hussein respond to that test? What has happened to the 1.5 tonnes of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a> agents, the 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals and the more than 30,000 special munitions? We know that the Iraqis are normally punctilious in their record keeping. If they have destroyed those munitions, fine, there must be records and evidence, but none has been produced in the past four months.</p> <p pid=".334.1/5">As for the scientists, the human factor is the weak link. Of course there is an aura of extreme intimidation of those scientists. If there is nothing to hide, why has Saddam Hussein gone to such trouble to prevent the scientists from being interviewed openly?</p> <p pid=".334.1/6">How should we operate in the next few weeks? We have to realise what is at stake: of course, it is the credibility of the UN, which has given a final opportunity. There can be no debate about the word "final". What should happen? Clearly, we have to focus on disarmament, not on regime change. We have to maintain maximum pressure, and not be forced by a military timetable.</p> <p pid=".334.1/7">Finally, my view is that the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> took a strategic decision to stand alongside <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>, and that has had positive effects. It was a courageous decision. It has given my right hon. Friend unique leverage, which should now be used to ensure that diplomatic options are pursued to an end. War is truly the last resort, but after 12 years, that "final opportunity" cannot go on indefinitely.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".335.0/1">I should like to pay tribute not only to <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=698" title="Our page on Donald Anderson - &#39;the right hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson)&#39;">Mr. Anderson</a> whom I follow in the debate, but to the enormously powerful speech made by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a>, who is sadly no longer with us. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Anyone who could doubt the moral elements of those remarks would clearly be challenged to make a more arresting or clearer case for what has been going on in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> at the moment.</p> <p pid=".335.0/2">During the last Gulf war, I, as usual, was stuck in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, but I saw many of my colleagues disappear to fight in the Gulf, with a spring in their step and with a light heart. They felt that they were going to be involved in a cause that was supported by the nation and a war that was justified and had moral, religious and political backing. Most of them, of course, had not seen battle before, but when they came back they were a different generation. Very few of them were killed in action. Some were killed, sadly, by the American air force, and a very few were killed by the enemy.</p> <p pid=".335.0/3">I am conscious of the fact that I am in the company of my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1190" title="Our page on Hugh Robertson - &#39;the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)&#39;">Hugh Robertson</a>, who was actually there, but I do not think that any of them who had killed a fellow man approached life in the same way again. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear the word "good" coming from the Labour Benches—quite right. Any hon. Member who has seen the pictures that have been shown recently of the killing on the Basra road cannot doubt what the consequences of war are.</p> <p pid=".335.0/4">I can clearly recall teaching a young naval officer at the staff college who had had the miserable opportunity of firing eight missiles into Iraqi gunboats. He freely admitted that the first one was challenging. There was a sense of elation when his missile struck home, and every member of the crew was killed. When he got back to his ship, the reaction began to set in. By the time that he was flying against his sixth, seventh and even eighth target, he was heartily sick of the whole prospect.</p> <p pid=".335.0/5">No hon. Member wants war, and the House needs to remember that, if we go to war, some of our young men and women will not come back, and probably tens of thousands of our enemies—I use the term advisedly—will die in this war. Some of them will be guilty, some innocent.</p> <p pid=".335.0/6">To that end, after much thought and much soul searching, despite the Government's wholly inconsistent arguments, I have come to believe that war has got to be credibly threatened, that the forces have got to be put in place, and that nothing except a cohesive and unified approach to war may allow peace to prevail.</p> <p pid=".335.0/7">I referred to the inconsistent arguments. Where has the argument about terrorism gone? Until a few weeks ago, it was one of the linchpins of the Government's case. Today, interestingly, no Front-Bench Member mentioned it. One or two speeches have referred to terrorism, and it is interesting to note that, without doubt, the events of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> have caused America to think in the way she is thinking at the moment. Let us think about this: although Australia helped in the campaign in Afghanistan, what really impelled that country to stand firmly behind the United Kingdom and the United States were the events in Bali.</p> <p pid=".335.0/8">So far this country has remained relatively untouched by such terrorism. I ask the House to remember exactly what happened 10 days or so ago. There was a major alert. For the first time in 10 years, light tanks were seen at Heathrow airport, troops were patrolling fly lines, and it was clear that there was a severe threat. Let us bear in mind the fact that, so far, in this country, only one policeman has been killed in the war on terrorism. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> is naive, however, if it does not remember that our intelligence agencies cannot give us the clear and unequivocal evidence necessary.</p> <p pid=".335.0/9">I do not believe that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> poses an imminent threat to his neighbours, to surrounding countries or to British possessions overseas. I am convinced, however—I may be alone in saying this—that he is behind much of the terrorist activity that goes on throughout the world. I believe, as I have said previously, that the House is unnecessarily hung up on the name bin Laden. I would not for one moment try to suggest that there is a direct connection between <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> and Baghdad. Let us look again, however, at the evidence that Mr. Powell produced of the link between Baghdad and other terrorist groups that are active inside this country. Let us read between the lines and see exactly what the intention of this tyrant with his weapons of mass destruction is. It cannot be stated openly, and I have challenged the Government on several occasions to prove the link. They have so far been unsuccessful, but I beg the House to understand that this threat is imminent and it is one that we have not yet experienced, despite this nation's understanding of the campaigns of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRA">IRA</a> and other terrorist organisations.</p> <p pid=".335.0/10">I end on this note: if we are to avoid war, we must try to be unified in our credible threat of force. The regime with which we are dealing is an evil one, which is bent on destruction. I fear that we must accept that, as we pursue this course, we will be more and more vulnerable to the sort of terrorism that I have mentioned. We must not be cowed or bullied, however, and we must stand up to terrorists as well as tyrants; only by being unified can we succeed.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".338.0/1">Of course I will confirm that. Having read the resolution, I am not surprised by my hon. Friend's point. However, it was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> who launched an unprovoked attack on Kuwait, so the world community was justified in wanting to see his weapons of mass destruction destroyed. Under resolution 687, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a> and the Security Council were given 45 days to set up a special commission, and a further 120 days to lay out the process of verification of the report made by Saddam Hussein. We know that by 1999, after a great deal of harassment, the inspectors decided that they could not carry on with their work and withdrew.</p> <p pid=".338.0/2">In the meantime, there was the no-fly zone policy, which provided for containment. It seemed to me that Saddam Hussein was quite happy with that. It left him, his family and his collaborators in power, living a life of wealth and luxury that the vast <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of his citizens could not even begin to dream about; and it meant that he was able to terrorise and kill people as he pleased, as my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a> graphically described. Thousands died every year in a state that did not comply with a United Nations resolution that could have solved the problem. The resolution could also have solved other problems in the wider middle east, by creating a nuclear-free zone. I think that all of us would like to see that.</p> <p pid=".338.0/3">At the outset of this debate, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> reassuringly said that there would be another vote in this House at, or around, the time that the second resolution was being put to the United Nations. I also got a clear feeling that there would be a vote before we went to war. I will support the motion tonight, but there should be a second United Nations resolution and a vote in this House to keep the pressure on Saddam Hussein. There is a possibility of sorting out this terrible démarche peacefully. However, there are moments when my heart begins to stop because of the actions of, in particular, the people around George Bush, who would lead us into a war.</p> <p pid=".338.0/4">Several speakers have deliberately overlooked a crucial point: the inspectors still have an important role in reporting to the United Nations about the credibility or otherwise of their efforts in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".338.0/5">"If Saddam is willing genuinely to co-operate, the inspectors should have up to July, and beyond July—as much time as they want."—[<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pop=1&amp;s=date:20030225+column:125+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 25 February 2003; Vol. 400, c. 125</a>.]</p> <p pid=".338.0/6">With those words echoing in my mind, I am happy to support the Government in the knowledge that we shall have further opportunities to debate the issue. If Dr. Blix reports that he is receiving co-operation from Saddam Hussein's regime, he will be given the time that he needs to carry out the inspections and to reveal the weapons of mass destruction. We can be thankful that the issue has been pushed to this point.</p> <p pid=".338.0/7">Like many people, I believe that the consequences of any war are incredibly difficult to judge. I have been involved in encouraging efforts to find a resolution to the Christian-Muslim conflict in Indonesia, where people are deeply fearful that a war in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> could result in a total upset of the work being done to try to maintain good relations between Muslims and Christians in that country. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Indonesia">Government of Indonesia</a> believe that it would be extremely difficult to control extremists and prevent them from getting the upper hand there. We already have the experience of the Bali bombing.</p> <p pid=".338.0/8">There is a tremendous amount at stake in the debate and the votes that follow it. However, from what my right hon. Friends the Foreign Secretary and the Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> have said—particularly from what the Prime Minister said yesterday—I believe that the inspectors will have the time to resolve the problem peacefully. In that context, I am very happy to support the Government tonight.</p></div>

I asked the Library about anthrax because the Government have always indicated that anthrax is measured in litres and I was interested in that point. It seems that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> has almost always deployed anthrax as wet anthrax. In those circumstances, it is extremely unlikely that that anthrax is still a weapons-grade material. There have been arguments about the storage of anthrax, which is why we need weapons inspectors to examine the situation. A report published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-09">9 September <span class="hi">2002</span></phrase> states:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".340.1/3">"wet anthrax from . . . the 1989–90 period—if stored properly—would still be infectious."</p> <p pid=".340.1/4">None the less, it would have to be stored properly, and the suggestion that it can be moved around is very difficult to support.</p> <p pid=".340.1/5">The document goes on to deal with sarin and cyclosarin, and says that both those chemicals would have deteriorated rapidly. US experts have considered chemical warfare agents that are less than 50 per cent. pure to be militarily ineffective. Indeed, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA">CIA</a> has said that it is extremely unlikely that those materials are more than 18 per cent. pure.</p> <p pid=".340.1/6">I understand that my time is short, so I shall make my point. We are talking about weapons of mass destruction that involve chemical and biological agents. The weapons inspectors must be in there to see whether indeed those materials still exist. If they do not exist, and everything has been produced since 1998, then yes, there is an issue, but it is not clear that there is an issue in terms of weapons of mass destruction. Until we are absolutely certain about the way forward—about whether we are talking about old deteriorated weapons of mass destruction or ones that have been made more recently—we should certainly not be going to war.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".341.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this very important debate.</p> <p pid=".341.0/2">It is important to re-emphasise that those of us who are opposed to war in this House and across our nation are not friends of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. We were against him when he invaded Iran, we opposed him when he invaded Kuwait and we spoke out against him when he used chemical weapons against his own people. Unfortunately, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> and US Governments supported and armed him in the 1980s. I am surprised that no apology was forthcoming from Conservative Front Benchers for supporting Saddam Hussein when he used chemical weapons against his own people. The American Administration is extremely well informed about <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> weaponry. As <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scotsman">The Scotsman</a></i> pointed out last Friday, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> probably still has the receipts. Like many opponents of military action, I am proud to say that we have been friends of the Iraqi people over two decades of Saddam's rule and we remain their friends today. We are concerned about the tens of thousands of lives at risk through an attack on <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. That is the real moral issue that we must all face.</p> <p pid=".341.0/3">The overwhelming <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of people in Britain support us in sharing that sceptical view. In my <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, my party membership is unanimously opposed to war, including the former <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> for Govan and <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Millan">Bruce Millan</a>. Among the general public, people from all walks of life are openly talking about <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to war, including Govan's most famous son, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Alex_Ferguson">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>. Given that we have seen more than 70,000 people gather in Glasgow alongside <span class="hi">1</span> million in London to demonstrate their opposition to war, I must ask my right hon. and hon. Friends on the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> if they are listening to the people of Scotland and of Britain. I have not found anyone outside this House—no one among the real people whom we seek to represent—who is in favour of war. People here and around the world are clearly against war. There is no groundswell of support for military action.</p> <p pid=".341.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_52">The 52</a> African Governments expressed their opposition at their recent summit. If <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore">Al Gore</a> had been elected President by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_Judges">Supreme Court Judges</a> instead of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W">George W</a>. Bush, we would have an American Administration opposed to war. Our own policy on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> demonstrates that the Government are not at the heart of Europe, but in the heart of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_George_Bush">President George Bush</a>. The policies of our key European allies, led by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Chirac">President Chirac</a> and <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> Schröder, are more in line with British opinion than my right hon. Friend the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>.</p> <p pid=".341.0/5">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_President">French President</a> expressed that clearly when he said,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".341.0/6">"there is no reason . . . to change our logic, which is the logic of peace and switch to a logic of war".</p> <p pid=".341.0/7">I do not doubt my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's good intentions but I disagree profoundly with his support for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>. I am suspicious of the genuine motive for the American position. Saddam Hussein is as great a monster today as he was 20 years ago. The only difference is that he was our monster then.</p> <p pid=".341.0/8"><span class="hi">Iraq</span> has the largest oil reserves in the world today. The American Administration is brimming with oil interests. Almost every key member, from President Bush downwards, has been heavily involved in the oil industry. The United States should not try to buy support in the United Nations Security Council. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_15">The 15</a> nations should be given enough objective evidence to reach a fair and independent assessment of the situation in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".341.0/9">The international coalition is being built with bribery and by bullying smaller nations such as Chile and Cameroon. That starkly contrasts with the joining of forces to repel <span class="hi">Iraq's</span> invasion of Kuwait. The business press always gives the bottom line on what is really happening. Yesterday, the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a></i> reported that America was preparing to pay a high price for support in its bargaining with Turkey. The <i>Financial Times</i> stated that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".341.0/10">"this time America's allies are waiting to be bought off", and that the cost would be dear in "hard cash" and "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOUs">IOUs</a>".</p> <p pid=".341.0/12">It is sad to see America's loyal ally, Turkey, "haggling furiously". From a first US offer of $2 billion to $<span class="hi">3</span> billion and an initial Turkish demand for $92 billion, it appears that a settlement of $16 billion has been reached. Is that any way to pull a stable international coalition together? Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, puts matters more starkly. He believes that it is</p> <p class="indent" pid=".341.0/13">"no longer a war against terrorism, it is in fact a war to dominate the world".</p> <p pid=".341.0/14">I recently spoke to Americans who opposed military action. They made it clear that their biggest problem is not President Bush but my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. If he did not support United States policy, any backing for war would collapse across the Atlantic. Those who argue that President Bush would go to war alone, without our Prime Minister's support, are wrong. President Bush needs <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_Blair">Prime Minister Blair</a> to sell the war in the United States. That is shown in the efforts to prove a tenuous link between al-Qaeda and Saddam, based on the presence of an al-Qaeda group in northern <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. It is disappointing that the fair-minded <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a> could present that to the United Nations as evidence.</p> <p pid=".341.0/15">We all know that al-Qaeda terrorists operate in Britain, the United States and many other nations. Clearly, that does not mean that our Government or any other support al-Qaeda. The claim has no credibility. Saddam and Osama bin Laden are implacable opponents. They oppose each other as much as President Bush opposes them both. We should not look for a spurious link to terrorism as an excuse for war against <span class="hi">Iraq</span>.</p> <p pid=".341.0/16"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> weapons inspectors are in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> for a reason. The international community sent Dr. Blix and the skilled inspectors to do a job. They should be allowed the time that they need to complete it.</p> <p pid=".341.0/17">I end with a quote from the leader comment in <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> today:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".341.0/18">"To go to war now would be to act without the freely given consent of the vast majority of nations; without the support of key allies; without a legally unambiguous mandate; without just cause, and against the wishes of the people of the west and the Muslim world."</p> <p pid=".341.0/19">I shall vote for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".343.2/1">The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on an important point. The <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurdistan">Iraqi Kurdistan</a> is fearful that Turkish troops will go into Kurdistan, which he thinks will be extremely damaging and destabilising. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that.</p> <p pid=".343.2/2">The fourth key issue is that we need to keep supplies of food and medicine going into Iraqi Kurdistan during any conflict period to help the millions who depend on them. In particular, we must continue aid immediately after any conflict finishes. Fifthly, we must get the oil-for-food money flowing properly under UN resolution 986 and stop the hold ups and possible corruption of that programme. Sixthly, we must assist <span class="hi">Iraq</span> post-Saddam to establish a federal state that is based on a parliamentary democracy with an autonomous Kurdish region. The Kurdish people do not now seek independence. Instead, they want to operate within a federal <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, with the oil reserves managed at a federal level and shared equitably between the regions. Finally, they hope that our Government will encourage the Turkish authorities to allow the 150 international journalists who are on the border in Turkey to pass into north <span class="hi">Iraq</span> so that they can see what is going on. That is in keeping with European standards and Turkey is holding them up.</p> <p pid=".343.2/3">We visited a refugee camp of 50,000 internally displaced people where thousands of families were still living in mud huts and tents. We met a family that had been thrown out of their home in Kirkuk by Saddam only two weeks earlier under his Arabisation ethnic cleansing programme. They suffered the sort of abuses that <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a> so eloquently outlined. Anyone who thinks that Saddam is safe in his box should have been with me to hear the tale of that family and to see the horrendous harm and devastation reaped on them by Saddam.</p> <p pid=".343.2/4">We also visited the Salahaddin university, which is close to Saddam's front-line army, and held meetings with lecturers and many English-speaking students. When we asked the students whether they thought that Saddam had chemical weapons and would use them, they stood up and shouted, "Of course." They thought it naive of me even to ask. They said that some of them had not slept for five nights because they were worried that Saddam would retaliate by using chemicals against them. People were trying to make improvised gas masks from plastic bags and electrical insulation tape.</p> <p pid=".343.2/5">The students were in no doubt that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction and, given half the chance, would use them on the Kurds again, causing the unimaginably terrible consequences that they experienced before. They wanted our protection, but in a show of hands voted unanimously for Saddam's regime to be removed as quickly and cleanly as possible for their safety. They were entirely in step with the other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurds">Iraqi Kurds</a> that we met. Other questions that we put to a formal vote to the students, who are the future of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, revealed that they think that war to remove Saddam is justified because, on balance, it would save thousands of innocent lives. However, they need our protection during such a war.</p> <p pid=".343.2/6">We visited the Freedom hospital in Arbil, which has cut its operations to only 25 per cent. in preparation for the expected war casualties. We saw doctors and nurses standing by empty beds, waiting. The hospital is stockpiling medicines and surgical equipment as part of a co-ordinated plan to deal with the casualties of that war. Its staff know that casualties will be forthcoming, and accept that.</p></div>

They suspect that Saddam will try to throw chemical weapons at them as soon as he knows that war is inevitable, and they want us to do the job properly this time.</p> <p pid=".344.1/4">As is the case with many other Members, this is the most difficult issue with which I have had to deal during my time as a parliamentarian, but the bottom line as regards morality is absolutely clear to me.

Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a>, although my conclusions are very different from hers. She spoke very movingly about the real issues, and <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1245" title="Our page on Bob Spink - &#39;the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)&#39;">Bob Spink</a> spoke in similar vein.</p> <p pid=".345.0/2">We must be clear about what is being proposed by both the Americans and the British through United Nations action. It is not regime change; it is the removal of weapons of mass destruction. There is a world of difference. This is not simply a narrow legal point: it is a very important technical and moral point, and it ultimately concerns where we will leave the world at the end of it all. If we are to talk of the need for regime change, we must bear in mind that there are many regimes in the world that we shall have to ask the United States and our own Government to investigate. Sadly, cruelty and barbarity are not the preserve of the odious Iraqi regime.</p> <p pid=".345.0/3">Let me explain why my conclusions are different from those of my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynon_Valley">Cynon Valley</a>. We know that during the last Gulf war some 100,000 people died as a direct or indirect consequence of military action. I believe that any military <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> driving all the way to Baghdad will cost more lives, both directly and indirectly. The aid agencies—the non-governmental organisations—are extremely concerned about the fragility of the infrastructure, which suggests that the death toll post-conflict, even with a military structure designed to bring in humanitarian aid, will be far higher than the death toll in Afghanistan, for instance, or the death toll in the aftermath of the last Gulf war. There is therefore a moral case for dealing with Saddam's brutality against his own people, and it cannot be wiped out by saying that going to war is the easy and obvious solution.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".345.2/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is important that those who advocate regime change examine the consequences.</p> <p pid=".345.2/2">Exactly what is the evidence for the threat that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> now poses to the rest of the world? Not many years ago, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> and Downing street, now briefing on the need for action, were briefing Ministers—I do not think that I am breaching the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Secrets_Act">Official Secrets Act</a>—on the success of weapons inspections and our ability through containment and deterrence to maintain downward pressure on Saddam and Baghdad. I appreciate that my hon. Friend the Under-<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Scotland, who is currently on the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, is not going to respond to the debate, but perhaps she will pass on my concerns. We need to know when and why that advice changed, as that is fundamental to the reasons why we are threatening to go to war against <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Frankly, there is no evidence for urgent action to prevent the proliferation of terrorist groups. Proliferation is less likely to occur in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> than in Russia, where the security of nuclear supplies is grossly inadequate. Our own Government and other Governments—the Americans are an honourable exception—have done almost nothing about the security of Russian nuclear supplies.</p> <p pid=".345.2/3">If we are serious about non-proliferation, let us start with Russia, and provide it with assistance. Or we could look at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a>, which has been a proliferator and has a programme to create weapons of mass destruction and the technology to deliver them. The United States rightly drew the conclusion that military action would be the wrong way to resolve the situation in North Korea. It is important that we learn those lessons, as the House has got to know why we are taking one route in respect of North Korea and another in respect of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. Some of my hon. Friends mocked when one of our colleagues talked about that the probability that military action would make the world more unstable and terrorism more likely. However, I well remember, even if they do not, that during the invasion of Kuwait pictures of Saddam were held up by dispossessed Palestinians. I condemn their actions, but we would be foolish and naive not to realise that any invasion of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will act as a recruiting ground for global terrorism. We ignore that at our peril.</p> <p pid=".345.2/4">At the moment, military action would be inhuman and cannot be justified as the moral war that a number of Members, particularly <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members, have discussed. It would make the world less stable for our own citizens and other people. We must therefore examine very carefully the lurch to war. Can inspection and containment work? In the early 1990s, weapons inspections were successful, and resulted in the destruction of weapons. It is important that we give the inspectors the opportunity to carry out the work that we have asked them to undertake, and that we do not curtail it artificially. If we do so, the suspicion of people around the world that this war was pre-ordained, perhaps even pre-ordered, will be confirmed, and it will be impossible to convince the Arab world and people throughout the world that there was ever any intention to resolve the issue by anything other than military action.</p> <p pid=".345.2/5">This country has far too much to lose to be bounced into a war at the request of another nation, even at the request of such a strong and good ally as the United States. I strongly urge our Government and the world community to maintain the pressure on Saddam, to maintain the threat of military action, and to maintain the inspection regime. However, a lurch to war would be at the cost of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and potentially of many of our own citizens, and of a world that would be massively less stable in the future.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".347.2/1">That was an excellent point of order. I hope that somebody is scurrying along the Corridors to find a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>.</p> <p pid=".347.2/2">Whatever is said in the debate, one thing is clear in my mind: if the time comes for British troops to go into action, they must have our full and unequivocal support. The debate today is about whether that time has come. It is not, as a number of hon. Members have said, about the integrity of the President of the United States of America. It is about the integrity of British foreign policy.</p> <p pid=".347.2/3">The commitment of British lives to the defence of our nation and to the halting of blatant atrocities is in our history. The campaign in Afghanistan to seek out al-Qaeda, its leader Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime that nurtured them, was a justified cause. But there is unfinished business in that country still. We have liberated the poppy farmers and the drug smugglers who now supply 90 per cent. of the heroin on our streets.</p> <p pid=".347.2/4">This debate is about <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. There is no doubt that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> is an evil dictator with scant regard for human rights. There is no doubt that in the past he has used chemical weapons against his own people. We know from the run-up to the last Gulf war that he sought an albeit crude delivery mechanism for his weapons. It is clear that, along with at least 10 other dubious regimes in the world, he would like to possess nuclear weapons.</p> <p pid=".347.2/5">Despite the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s claims of "linkage", there is no evidence that Saddam has assisted al-Qaeda. There are Governments with whom we have good relations who have given much greater comfort to those evil terrorists. We await the evidence of the weapons inspectors that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction. If he possesses them, the evidence is clear that the range of any of his delivery mechanisms would be a threat to his near neighbours, most of whom seem totally unconvinced of the need for the war at the present time.</p> <p pid=".347.2/6">Opinion polls seem to suggest that the British people are unconvinced of the need for war. The letters, e-mails and lobbying from my constituents show me that there is severe disquiet in Dorset, as elsewhere, about this venture. In 1939 the case for war was clear and the people were in support. Hitler was an evil expansionist dictator who had to be restrained and defeated. In 1982 the decision to remove Argentine troops by force from the Falklands had the support of the British people. In 1990 the invasion of Kuwait was a clear act of aggression that had to be rectified by the use of force, and the British people agreed. There is, at this time, no clear act of aggression, and no invasion of another nation's territory. The British people—in fact, the peoples of the democratic, civilised world—remain unconvinced that we cannot rectify breaches of UN resolutions by peaceful means.</p></div>

Friend for his <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. I would never suggest that we should go to war by opinion poll. I do suggest, however, that the actions of the Government should have the consent of the people before they are enacted.</p> <p pid=".348.1/2">I want to move on to a more important point, which is that one quarter of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a> has now been committed to the Gulf region for a war. They are the sons, daughters, husbands and wives of loyal, patriotic British people—parents and partners who have just pride in their loved ones who are going off to war. Like most Members of the House, I am too young to have known war, but, for the first time, I am one of those parents who will see one of their children enter the theatre of war. Along with tens of thousands of other British parents, I have seen a child of mine leave these shores to fight a war in a far-off land. My daughter is one of the small band of Army surgeons who are already in the Gulf for a war that now seems unstoppable.</p> <p pid=".348.1/3">It may be the nature of our modern democracy, but I, as the elected representative of 75,000 citizens, find it inconceivable that I will not have the chance to vote for or against this war. I am no pacifist, but I have spent my entire life believing in the politics of peace. I would love to see the removal of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> for the sake of the Iraqi people, but I would also like to see a host of other regimes disappear—in Burma, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a>, Libya, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and Zimbabwe, to name just a few. In justifying this form of pre-emptive action, parallels are being drawn with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. They are spurious. I will support an attack on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> if Saddam Hussein is shown to possess offensive weapons of mass destruction that pose a threat to the civilised world. Such support will not be given lightly, and must be bolstered by an affirmative resolution both at the United Nations and in the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>.</p> <p pid=".348.1/4">I have signed and will support the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> tabled in the name of <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1232" title="Our page on Chris Smith - &#39;the right hon.

It sends a clear message to the Government that we are not yet convinced that the time has come to commit the lives of British troops, or to wreak death on the innocent people of <span class="hi">Iraq</span> in pursuit of their leader.

Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1245" title="Our page on Bob Spink - &#39;the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)&#39;">Bob Spink</a>. The hon. Lady's speech was eloquent and detailed in its account of the torture, abuse and murder conducted by the regime. I have so far been unconvinced by the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, George Bush or others on the Government <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>—<i>[Laughter.]</i> However, if the hon. Lady had been on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Bench">Front Bench</a> for the last six months, I might not be supporting the amendment this evening. I am also not convinced that the time has come to risk political turmoil in the Arab world, or to risk reprisals here at home from fundamentalist terrorists of whatever hue. Whatever the mandate of our troops in the field, if the decision is taken to go to war, every one of those British service men and women will deserve our full and unequivocal support.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".349.0/1">After five hours of debate, it is difficult to make a point that has not already been raised. Nevertheless, that gives one the opportunity to reflect on the debate, and it is in that spirit that I say that I had intended to declare my support for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> tabled by my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1232" title="Our page on Chris Smith - &#39;the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith)&#39;">Mr. Smith</a>, and nothing I have heard in the debate has persuaded me that I should change my mind.</p> <p pid=".349.0/2">My right hon. Friend made the fundamental point that he sought to persuade the House that the case for military action is, as yet, unproven. I believe that to be the case. However—and other hon. Members who will support the amendment tonight may disagree—I cannot pretend that I have not been impressed by my colleagues on the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, including the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>. Some hon. Members have gone over the top in their criticisms of the role that my right hon. Friends have played.</p> <p pid=".349.0/3">I am not regarded as a critic of the United States, and I do not take the view that our Prime <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and Foreign Secretary have simply responded to everything that the United States has said. Indeed, whatever criticisms I might have, I believe that when the history of this period is written, it may well record that—far from the picture painted by, I am sorry to say, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1208" title="Our page on Alex Salmond - &#39;the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)&#39;">Mr. Salmond</a>, for example—our Prime Minister had a great influence towards caution and stability on the part of the United States. Without him, Bush would not have gone to the United Nations at all.</p> <p pid=".349.0/4">That said, we are entitled to consider the consequences of a unilateral declaration of war. In common with <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=802" title="Our page on Kenneth Clarke - &#39;the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#39;">Mr. Clarke</a>, I take the view that some in the US Administration had already determined their position some time ago. I regret that whatever the arguments and the force of public opinion—and whatever the views expressed in this House—some in Washington seem determined to take unilateral action, and that could be very costly indeed.</p> <p pid=".349.0/5">Already we see problems in international organisations that I firmly support. I regret the unease in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>, the disagreements within the European Union and, above all, the questions of credibility that have been placed at the door of the United Nations. I am sorry that, even during this debate, several hon. Members have said that if we do not respond to unilateral action, we will be following the route of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations">League of Nations</a>. That organisation was destroyed because people failed to give it the kind of support that the United Nations is entitled to expect, not least from this House today.</p> <p pid=".349.0/6">On some of my visits abroad, I have seen evidence of the carnage that hon. Members on both sides of the House have mentioned in their speeches. I have visited Kurdistan on two occasions. I do not necessarily reach the same conclusions as <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1245" title="Our page on Bob Spink - &#39;the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)&#39;">Bob Spink</a>, and my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=814" title="Our page on Michael Connarty - &#39;the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty)&#39;">Mr. Connarty</a> tells me that he intends to support the amendment. When I visited Iran in the late 1980s, I saw the evidence of people suffering from the use of chemical weapons by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. But in view of that, is it not all the more necessary that we should confirm the importance of the United Nations and its agencies in seeking a response to these problems?</p> <p pid=".349.0/7">More recently I visited Rwanda with some of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1023" title="Our page on Oona King - &#39;the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King)&#39;">Ms King</a>. We saw there the aftermath of sheer genocide, a million people dying out of a population of 9 million, and we saw people now trying to deal with what took place.</p> <p pid=".349.0/8">I do not want to weaken the United Nations' influence in circumstances like that. I want to strengthen it, but I do not believe that it would be strengthened by unilateral action. It is right that my right hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury should give the lead tonight by inviting the House to express that view.</p> <p pid=".349.0/9">I am concerned about humanitarian considerations. That is why I am very keen to hear what Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> eventually has to say. I do not believe that we should rush to judgment, nor do I believe that the British people feel that we should do so. If those of us who supported the Government's actions on Afghanistan on humanitarian grounds, and who supported the Government's actions on Kosovo on humanitarian grounds, take the view that there are grave concerns about the humanitarian consequences of war with <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, that seems to me entirely logical, a position shared by virtually all the aid agencies and non-governmental organisations, including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAFOD">CAFOD</a>, and one to be taken seriously.</p> <p pid=".349.0/10">We want to avoid refugees. We want to avoid carnage. We want, if we can, to avoid war. That may not be possible, but I believe that it is right and that it strengthens the role of those who desperately search for peace to support my right hon. Friend's amendment, in the hope that we are addressing the concerns, not just of our own people, but of an increasingly disenchanted world.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".350.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-15">15 February</phrase> some 1,000 of my constituents took to the streets to protest against the possibility of this country going to war in <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. To hon. Members who perhaps represent more compact areas, with perhaps more of a tradition of militant demonstration, that may not sound like much, but I am told that the 700 people who marched through the streets of Lerwick provided a sight that had never been seen before in the northern isles.</p> <p pid=".350.0/2">Those demonstrating ranged from the 700 marching in Lerwick, through people demonstrating on the steps of St. Magnus cathedral in Kirkwall, to a dozen or so parents and children demonstrating in the very small island of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ronaldsay">North Ronaldsay</a>. The people who took to the streets to demonstrate were not wild-eyed extremists. Most of them were first-time protesters. Some were pacifists, but many were not. For the large part, they were teachers, crofters, fishermen, housewives, children—a whole range of people in the isles who wanted to make their view known. That view was that the case had not been made for war.</p> <p pid=".350.0/3">The reason I bring this up at this stage is that I think that the advent of these mass demonstrations—400,000 last year supporting the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countryside_Alliance">Countryside Alliance</a>, <span class="hi">1</span> million against war in Iraq—is part of an ongoing process of disengagement from the party political process which we are part of here, as people find another way to express their views—views which they hope may influence the course of events.</p> <p pid=".350.0/4">The Government cannot be allowed to ignore the fact that they have not persuaded the public of the case for war. They must understand that the consequence of entering a war supported by the British Government but not by the British people will be to see an acceleration of that process of disengagement between people and politics. It would be a grotesque irony if we went to war in order to bring democracy to <span class="hi">Iraq</span> and in so doing dealt a fatal blow to the democratic institutions of our own country.</p> <p pid=".350.0/5">Much has been said during the debate about the despotism and loathsome record of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. I was immensely impressed by the contribution of <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a>, in particular. I, too, recall a friend from university days. He was an Iraqi student studying at Glasgow university, and he wept bitter tears as he told me in 1983 of the terrible things that Saddam Hussein was doing to his people, and of how desperate he was to make those in the west aware of the situation. However, nothing happened, because it suited this country and its foreign policy for nothing to happen. Then, we were quite happy for Saddam Hussein to be engaged in a war with Iran. Against that background, I am unable to say that I would never countenance going to war against <span class="hi">Iraq</span>; however, I cannot say that I am prepared for such action to be taken at the moment. The implications of war in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will reach far beyond the boundaries of that country. Every bomb that is dropped on <span class="hi">Iraq</span> will be like a stone dropped into water: it will create ripples that spread far and wide.</p> <p pid=".350.0/6">In his speech today, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> spoke at some length about 12 years of UN resolutions on <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. He also said a little about the double standards applied by the international community to the situation in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_Palestine">Israel and Palestine</a>, but he did not say much about UN resolutions there. I remind the House that it is 36 years since the first such resolution—242, which called on Israel to relinquish control of territories occupied in the war of 1967—was passed. Last year, five Security Council resolutions were passed relating to Israel and Palestine: 1397, 1402, 1403, 1405 and 1435. Resolution 1397</p> <p class="indent" pid=".350.0/7">"Demands immediate cessation of all acts of violence, including all acts of terror, provocation, incitement and destruction".</p> <p pid=".350.0/8">Yet as recently as last Sunday, six Palestinians were killed and 20 were injured during an Israeli raid in Gaza.</p></div>

The Government will have to explain why we are prepared to value some UN resolutions so much more highly than others. I am sad to say that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>'s words this afternoon had a rather hollow ring, and I am afraid that they will be greeted with anger and disbelief throughout the Arab world.</p> <p pid=".352.1/2">I want to say a few brief words about the United Nations. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> is essential in order to put some moral legitimacy behind this issue, but such legitimacy is diminished every time that the US takes a bullying or bribing step. I want our Government to do much more when the US makes statements such as George Bush's reference to the UN's "so-called" weapons inspectors. Why does our <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> not contradict him and stand up for the UN when he says such things? I also fail to see how a Government who purport to be committed to the UN as a means of resolving this issue can countenance introducing a resolution while Dr. Blix is still asking for more time. As my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1119" title="Our page on Michael Moore - &#39;the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore)&#39;">Mr. Moore</a> said, the implication is that the United Kingdom and the United States want to go to war before Dr. Blix has done his job.</p> <p pid=".352.1/3">If the Government are going to persuade me at all, the spinning has got to stop—there can be no more dodgy dossiers. The stakes are exceptionally high, and if we are to put the lives of our troops at risk, we must do better. The troops deserve better, the public deserve better and this House deserves better, and until we get it the Government will not have my support.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".352.2/1">Nothing can weigh more heavily on a democratically elected politician than the decision to go to war. That is why, when I was called into the Whips' Office and asked if I would vote with the Government to take military action if <span class="hi">Iraq</span> failed to disarm, I said no. I said that I could not vote with the Government. My reasoning was that <span class="hi">Iraq</span> had not had enough time to comply with the UN and that, if <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> were given further time, he might disarm.</p> <p pid=".352.2/2">That conversation took place on <phrase class="date" code="1998-02-17">17 February 1998</phrase>—exactly five years ago. Was I right? Obviously not. What happened in the intervening five years? Saddam Hussein rebuilt his chemical processors. He constructed a missile test stand, as we have heard, to test weapons with four times the power of the al-Samoud missiles. He imported hundreds of missile engines, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> confirmed in his report to the UN last month. He tried to buy enriched uranium to build a nuclear bomb. He continued his policies of repression, which, according to conservative estimates, have caused the deaths of 100,000 civilians, most of them Muslim. He has continued to flout the authority of the UN, and has made a mockery of international law.</p> <p pid=".352.2/3">In 1991, UN resolution 687 gave Saddam Hussein 15 days to disarm—a fortnight. Twelve years on, no one can deny that the only shred of progress that has been made is the result of the immediate and credible threat of force. Do we therefore give Saddam Hussein more time? Five years after pleading for that course of action, I recognise its futility.</p> <p pid=".352.2/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> inspectors should be supported in their mission, but it is clear that Saddam Hussein is not co-operating. He continues to play games, declaring this week that he would never destroy his al-Samoud missiles so that he can do just that next week or the week after and thereby claim compliance. However, the games that Saddam Hussein is playing are not really the issue. Everyone agrees that he has not co-operated fully; what we disagree about is the international community's response.</p> <p pid=".352.2/5">There are five main reasons why people oppose military action to disarm Saddam Hussein. First, on balance, they believe that loss of life will be greater if there is military action than if we stay with the status quo. Other hon. Members have outlined eloquently the bloody cost of the status quo. Suffice it to say that inaction can sometimes cause as much loss of life as action. Secondly, people think that Saddam Hussein should be given more time. Five years ago, I agreed with that, but now I do not. Thirdly, people want a second UN resolution—so do I. Fourthly, people think that the Government are pursuing, and pushing for, action against <span class="hi">Iraq</span> only because of what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W">George W</a>. Bush wants. I shall return to that point.Fifthly, people think that regime change is not an acceptable objective. They are right, but I want regime change—in Washington.</p> <p pid=".352.2/6">People have spoken about anti-Americanism. They wonder why some people are sickened by George W. Bush. I shall explain why I am sickened by him. His double standards sicken me. The fact that he surrounds himself with religious fundamentalists sickens me. The fact that he is in the pocket of the oil industry sickens me. Above all, the fact that he bankrolls <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> to continue the slaughter of Palestinians sickens me.</p> <p pid=".352.2/7">Israel can flout all the UN resolutions in the world, invade its neighbours' territories, develop weapons of mass destruction, and it does not even get a ticking off from George W. Bush. However, the question is not the extent to which George W. Bush is reprehensible; it is whether he is responsible for British Government policy.</p> <p pid=".352.2/8">I was going to say that the problem I have with that theory is that George W. Bush was not elected when the Government first tabled a resolution on this subject, but he was never elected. So I shall rephrase it and say that George W. Bush was not President when this Government first tabled a resolution that was very similar to the one considered today. George W. Bush was not President when Britain was at the forefront of efforts in the UN to disarm Saddam Hussein.</p> <p pid=".352.2/9">The present Leader of the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>, my right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - &#39;the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)&#39;">Mr. Cook</a>, was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> when the debate was held on <phrase class="date" code="1998-02-17">17 February 1998</phrase>. He said that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".352.2/10">"the House can be proud that, throughout the present crisis, Britain has taken the lead in drafting work at the UN."—[<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pop=1&amp;s=date:19980217+column:899+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 17 February 1998; Vol. 306, c. 899</a>.]</p> <p pid=".352.2/11">We were taking the lead when George W. Bush was still playing with his oil wells, so the question is this: if we decide on a course of action, does that course of action become invalid because someone who sickens us agrees with us?</p> <p pid=".352.2/12">On a lighter note, I had to ask myself the same question during the debate on hunting, when <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1317" title="Our page on Ann Widdecombe - &#39;the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe)&#39;">Miss Widdecombe</a> gave an impassioned speech to ban hunting. I almost became pro-hunting, but not quite. The point is that, on a question of conscience, all Members must vote on the basis on what they believe to be right, not on what anyone else believes to be right. That is what I and most other hon. Members will do. I agree with the text that we shall vote on today:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".352.2/13">"That this House . . . calls upon <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to recognise this as its final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations."</p> <p pid=".352.2/14">That is what I believe in; that is what I will vote for.</p> <p pid=".352.2/15">Turning to related concerns—Afghanistan—Britain is working flat out to shore up that tortured country. Where are the Americans? Why have they not upheld their promise not to walk away from the people of Afghanistan? Is it because there is no oil in that country? What of post-war <span class="hi">Iraq</span>? Will the Foreign Secretary confirm that the Government favour a UN Administration, not an American oligarchy? What of the middle east? The Government must make further progress on the middle east.</p> <p pid=".352.2/16">Will the Foreign Secretary assure me that Britain will look at securing a UN resolution, forcing Israel back to its 1967 borders and, in the long term, securing a viable Palestinian state? Will he further assure me that if such a resolution faced an unreasonable veto by a Security Council member—for example, America—Britain would still take action outside the UN, if necessary, to secure justice for Palestinians?</p> <p pid=".352.2/17">Finally, I want to mention the extremely difficult situation facing Muslims in this country and in my <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. Ever since the events of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>, Muslims have been under suspicion purely on account of their faith. Most Muslims and, indeed, most Asians have reported increased antagonism. That is because the war on terror means something different to everyone. It is spreading its tentacles in a confused and insidious manner. It has become a war on asylum seekers, refugees and, by extension, various ethnic minorities. At its most extreme and stupid, it has become a war on men with beards. It is disgraceful that it is being allowed to drift in that way, and I know that several Members agree.</p> <p pid=".352.2/18">Let us be clear what this should be about: it is about disarming rogue states with weapons of mass destruction and preventing a future scenario—not a past one—where terrorist networks get hold of weapons of mass destruction, such as anthrax and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a> nerve gas, from a rogue states such as <span class="hi">Iraq</span>, and deploy them in another country such as Britain.</p></div>

I appeal to the Government to expand on this matter in the media, so that my constituents and others can be convinced of that cause.</p> <p pid=".354.1/3">UN resolution 1441 must be upheld in one way or another, although the UN's credibility would be hugely strengthened if a further resolution could be obtained, even if it is passed by just a <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the members of the Security Council, not unanimously. It is clear that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> is one of the biggest tyrants that the world has ever seen, and that he is continuing to try to acquire weapons of mass destruction. As recently as last March, he tried to acquire rocket motors to have rockets with a far greater launch capability.</p> <p pid=".354.1/4">It is also clear that, in the 12 years since the Gulf war, some 360,000 children have been killed in <span class="hi">Iraq</span> as a result of Saddam Hussein's activities. That man has to be stopped; his weapons of mass destruction have to be removed one way or another, and he has to be convinced that the UN and world consortium is tightening the ratchet around him and that he will not be allowed to get away with it.</p> <p pid=".354.1/5">In the minute that I have left, I should like to talk about the aftermath of the war. If the case of the British Government is that we are relieving the suffering of the Iraqi people, we must surely also strenuously ensure that, in the aftermath of war, the humanitarian and oil-for-food aid is quickly disseminated among the Iraqi people, so that their long-held suffering can be ended as soon as possible.</p> <p pid=".354.1/6">The stability of the middle east will be of paramount importance after the war, particularly given its neighbour, Iran, which has a large air force and a navy. It is essential that a strongly based interim Government are put in place quickly after the war.</p> <p pid=".354.1/7">Finally, it is essential that the UN resolutions on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel-Palestine">Israel-Palestine</a> situation are rigorously enforced and upheld; otherwise, the base for terrorism in Palestine from Hamas and other extremist Islamic organisations will remain, and there will still be a launch pad for terrorism from that part of the world.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".355.0/1">Today's debate has been important for the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>. It has been a tribute to the skills, knowledge and passions contained in the House.</p> <p pid=".355.0/2">In the last few hours, nearly 40 Members have spoken. I think that all of us are decent people wrestling with a profound dilemma that will shape the world for decades. As I scour the names added to the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> of <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1232" title="Our page on Chris Smith - &#39;the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith)&#39;">Mr. Smith</a>, I assure him and all those who have signed it that I do so with complete respect, and that is not just because he is my pair—not yet invoked, given the current parliamentary imbalance. He and his co-signatories have an honest and cogent position, which nobody has the right to deride.</p> <p pid=".355.0/3">In summing up this debate, I hope that, in return, the House will accept that I in no way represent the slightly nasty caricature used to label us by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1226" title="Our page on Alan Simpson - &#39;the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)&#39;">Alan Simpson</a>, which was uncharacteristic on his part: keen-to-bomb Tories. That is far from our position. I have lived and breathed the events of the middle east for nearly 20 years. I have tried to learn its history and to travel to all corners of the middle east. I have met many of its rulers and its people and have explored its culture and society.</p> <p pid=".355.0/4">Let me therefore try to address the arguments that have been put primarily by those who support the amendment, which was signed by well over 100 people today. Let me say at the outset that the core argument of the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury was that if the amendment were rejected, that would be seen as signifying war. As in so much of what we are discussing, however, an equal and opposite argument exists. The obverse of what he says is that, if the amendment were accepted, that could be seen as signifying a weakening of resolve.</p> <p pid=".355.0/5">I shall approach the arguments of the right hon. Gentleman's supporters in three areas, which I hope will sum up the whole of tonight's debate. In viewing the prospect of war, we must examine and assess the reasons for it, the authority for it and its repercussions. The reasons have been discussed in depth. Many believe that the prospect of war and the reasons for it are unproven, that it is unnecessary, and that we should leave <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> be. I used to believe that containment would suffice. I thought for a long time that Saddam Hussein was a bit like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Tito">Marshall Tito</a> in Yugoslavia—a bad but not necessarily mad man who confined his nastiness to his own country, and who should therefore be tolerated, even though it was distasteful to do so. I have come to believe, however, that Saddam's possession of biological and chemical weapons in particular pose a genuine and serious risk, to the point at which a single glass of anthrax left on the London tube could kill all the people who went on the march in London last Saturday. If a capability of that sort were ever to get into the wrong hands, it would unleash danger in the world the like of which we have never been called on to contend with previously.</p></div>

Gentleman will forgive me if I do not <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a>.</p> <p pid=".356.1/2">We must appreciate that we are in new territory. It is difficult to carry public opinion when the threat is intangible and when we do not see a conventional reason for war or conflict—as we did in the Falklands or Kuwait, when tanks or planes had gone into another country. We have to assess whether the risk of doing nothing is, as we believe it to be, greater than the risk of doing something.</p> <p pid=".356.1/3">We are in a whole new realm of moral calculation, the like of which we have not had to face before. We may be required to act without those conventionally accepted reasons for doing so. On the Conservative Benches, we admit that the Government, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> and the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>—and all who sit on Labour Benches and, indeed, on our Benches—are in a very difficult position. If the Government are to fulfil their duty as the guardian of their own and other people's security, they will, instead of being popular by following, have to risk being unpopular by leading.</p> <p pid=".356.1/4">Let me turn to the second element that has dominated today's debate, which is the question of the authority that may lie—and, in our view, does lie—behind any decision that has now to be taken. In addressing this vexed moral calculation, the world—and almost everyone in this House—has vested that authority in the United Nations. As has been rehearsed here today, the United Nations has produced a series of resolutions over many years. In arriving at resolution 1441, we are at the 17th or 18th resolution. We have vested authority in the United Nations, and resolution 1441 calls for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> to disarm immediately or face serious consequences.</p></div>

Gentleman will forgive me if I do not <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a>.</p> <p pid=".357.3/2">I say to those contributors that there is yet a chance for peace. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> is the one man in the world who can yet guarantee that there is no conflict.</p> <p pid=".357.3/3">Let me canter through the rest of my points about authority. We would like to see a second resolution. It is a political requirement and we would like to see it if we can. We do not believe that it is legally necessary but—if, in this new moral calculation, we are to draw people in a democracy behind the action that may be taken—it is essential to achieve that second resolution. I wish the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> and his counterparts well in trying to secure it. I hope too that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League">Arab League</a> may yet continue in its efforts to persuade Saddam Hussein to leave Baghdad so that we can be spared conflict.</p> <p pid=".357.3/4">To all those who have signed today's <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, I say this forcibly: if we are to go down the UN route, it is important to stick with the UN route. I would argue that people in the European Union or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>—or even in this House—do not have the authority to second-guess or dilute resolutions that the United Nations has already passed.</p> <p pid=".357.3/5">Forty Members have spoken in this debate and, although it will be invidious to single anybody out, I will. My right hon. and learned Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=802" title="Our page on Kenneth Clarke - &#39;the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#39;">Mr. Clarke</a> argued for time. He was perplexed about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> and asked about attitude. That was a Blix word. Hans Blix has said that the attitude of Saddam Hussein matters much more than time, although the resolution uses the word "immediate". <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=856" title="Our page on Frank Dobson - &#39;The right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)&#39;">Mr. Dobson</a> gave a powerful synopsis and summary of the dangers that face the broader region. Once again, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a>, who was heard in absolute silence, made an emotional appeal that no one can have failed to have been moved by.</p> <p pid=".357.3/6">However, I cannot have any respect for the position that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> have taken today. One day the leader of the Liberal Democrats is a UN supporter and then he says that it does not have any power. One day he says that Saddam is a threat and then he says that there is no proof. He is anti-war, pro-war, multilateral and unilateral. He is friend of America and then he does not really like America. He is pro-sanctions and against sanctions. He says that we should listen to the inspectors and then give Saddam more time. Then he is pro a second resolution.</p></div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content"><p pid=".359.1/1">This has been a fine debate with a number of excellent speeches. Indeed, in many ways, it has been a very passionate debate, as should be the case given that we are dealing with the issue of whether this country is to take further action and what sort of action it should be, with the need to go back to the UN with a second resolution and with the need to ensure that we express the views of people throughout the country who rightly want to know that this House is reflecting their concerns. Today, in this debate, the House has reflected views and concerns across the country.</p> <p pid=".359.1/2">I thank hon. Members for their contributions. In particular, I thank <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=867" title="Our page on Alan Duncan - &#39;the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan)&#39;">Mr. Duncan</a> for what I thought was an excellent performance. We especially enjoyed his yes/no interlude, which illustrated something with which Labour Members are just as familiar as <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members. I should also like to thank a number of my right hon. and hon. Friends—my right hon. Friends the Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_Gorton">Manchester, Gorton</a> (Mr. Kaufman), for Walsall, South (Mr. George) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrick,_Cumnock_and_Doon_Valley">Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley</a> (Mr. Foulkes), and my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=927" title="Our page on Win Griffiths - &#39;the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths)&#39;">Mr. Griffiths</a>. I give particular thanks to my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - &#39;the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)&#39;">Ann Clwyd</a>, who made a powerful speech. I also thank my hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1023" title="Our page on Oona King - &#39;the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King)&#39;">Ms King</a>; I thought that she was getting a bit wobbly at one point, but she convinced me that she was not. I thank all hon. Members for their support today.</p> <p pid=".359.1/3">On the Opposition Benches, I acknowledge the very robust performance from <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=802" title="Our page on Kenneth Clarke - &#39;the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#39;">Mr. Clarke</a> that we expect of him.</p> <p pid=".359.1/4">I also congratulate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=903" title="Our page on George Galloway - &#39;the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvin (Mr. Galloway)&#39;">Mr. Galloway</a> on his oratorical flourish. I praise him only because I know that it will irritate him greatly to be praised from the Labour <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>—and even though I disagreed with the content of his speech.</p> <p pid=".359.1/5">The motion before the House is not an endorsement of military action by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> forces. No decision has yet been taken to deploy British forces in action. The motion supports the UN route to disarmament. Let me be clear: the Government will put any decision on military action to the House, subject in terms of timing only to the safety of our forces. It is in our interests as a Government to ensure that the House has the chance to vote before hostilities. We will also want a full opportunity to debate and vote on the outcome of proceedings at the UN on the second resolution, so there is an opportunity for another vote.</p></div>

The evidence comes from the UN reports, from Dr. Blix, from our own intelligence and indeed from Saddam Hussein himself, who last night, oddly, admitted that the Iraqis had found a biological bomb and wanted to show us. Let us be clear: Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and he is a threat to his people, his neighbours and ultimately the middle east and the wider world. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> is in no doubt about that. That is why its resolution 1441 gave Saddam Hussein a final opportunity to comply with a string of legally binding obligations imposed on him over the past 12 years. Nearly four months later, Saddam Hussein has not taken that final opportunity. I cannot put the matter more crisply than Dr. Blix. He has reported that <span class="hi">Iraq</span></p> <p class="indent" pid=".360.1/3">"appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance . . . of the disarmament which was demanded of it".</p> <p pid=".360.1/4">Indeed, Dr. Blix said today that at the moment it is not even clear whether the Iraqis really want to co-operate. My right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=1232" title="Our page on Chris Smith - &#39;the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith)&#39;">Mr. Smith</a> said that Saddam Hussein had co-operated by 70 per cent. Well, Dr. Blix disagrees. My right hon. Friend accepts that the declaration provided by Saddam Hussein is inadequate. Indeed, the UN resolution requires it to be a full and final declaration of all the weapons of mass destruction held by Saddam Hussein in order to allow the inspectors to audit that declaration. If that declaration is not full and if it is not final, there has been no co-operation at all, because the only co-operation has been not on substance but on process. Saddam has shown throughout the past 12 years that he will continue to co-operate on issues of procedure, but he does not co-operate on the substance of disarmament. That is where we must not allow him to play games with Members of this House, with this country or with the United Nations.</p></div>

They cannot fulfil their mandate without Iraqi co-operation. They are not detectives who are looking for clues or a needle in a haystack the size of <span class="hi">Iraq</span>. They are auditors, who audit the Iraqi declaration. Given that it is neither full nor complete—no one seriously disputes that—all the time in the world will not enable the inspectors to do that. Regardless of numbers, the job is impossible. We can give them all the time in the world, but without the complete declaration, the exercise is pointless. Resolution 1441 is explicit about the need for complete co-operation.</p></div>

His people, his neighbours and his region have lived in fear of him for years. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> has passed resolution 1441 and offered him a final opportunity to comply with legally binding obligations. He has not taken that opportunity and he appears to have no intention of doing so. In those circumstances, there is a limit to what the inspectors can achieve. They cannot fulfil their mandate without Iraqi co-operation.</p> <p pid=".362.4/3">We have proposed a two-part strategy. First, we, Spain and the US tabled a draft resolution on Monday in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a>. Secondly, it will not be put to the vote immediately. It is therefore not too late for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> to comply, but he must do so if military action is to be avoided. There is still time for <span class="hi">Iraq</span> to make the right choice, but the onus is on Saddam to co-operate on matters of substance.</p> <p pid=".362.4/4">My right hon. Friend <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?m=908" title="Our page on Bruce George - &#39;the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)&#39;">Mr. George</a> said that we cannot trust Saddam Hussein. We need to send Saddam a clear message that he must comply in full with resolution 1441 now—not in 120 days, not in four months and not in one year, but now. That is the real route to peace. Saddam Hussein needs a clear message tonight. If we fail to provide that, we will send the wrong message: that UN resolutions can be ignored. We intend to send the right message: that UN resolutions will be enforced; that international law will be complied with; and that other dictators should not pursue weapons of mass destruction because the international community will intervene.</p></div>
