This [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook is part of the chapter 'Discourse Network Anylsis' in *The Routledge Handbook of Foreign Policy Methods* (edited by Patrick A. Mello & Falk Ostermann). It gives readers a more detailed discussion of the coding-scheme, allows them access to the dataset and the script used for analysis, and shows further graphs that are not used in the chapter, due to page-limitation.

<!-- This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.  -->

<!-- Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- plot(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*. -->

<!-- When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).  -->

<!-- The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. -->
