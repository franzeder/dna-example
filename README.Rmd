# Abstract

This [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook is part of the chapter 'Discourse Network Anylsis' in *The Routledge Handbook of Foreign Policy Methods* (edited by Patrick A. Mello & Falk Ostermann). It gives readers a more detailed discussion of DNA as a the method, the coding-scheme, allows them access to the dataset and the script used for analysis, and shows further graphs that are not used in the chapter, due to page-limitation.

# DNA as a Method

Methodologically, DNA proceeds in two stages and uses a combination of qualitative content analysis and social network analysis for grasping the statements of actors and relating them to each other [@Leifeld2013, 169]. The data basis for this analysis are texts from various sources that are openly available. In the first stage, researchers look for actors' statements in these texts and annotate them using a coding-scheme [@Leifeld2018, 304]. Statements must be made public by actors to be instrumental in a discourse [@Leifeld2018, 301]. Hence, we can refer to a variety of textual data, such as newspaper articles, parliamentary speeches or testimonies, interviews, or position papers, to search for statements. The final decision which text formats are the most suitable for determining political claims depends on the discursive arena we seek to investigate.

These texts are then annotated using a category-based coding-scheme. We can either deductively or inductively [@Bauer2000; @Schreier2014] develop these codes or combine both approaches. Deductively generated codes are developed top-down, inspired by theoretical assumptions researchers seek to verify. In contrast to that, inductively generated codes are developed during the process of coding itself. Combining both approaches is a common and promising procedure because it allows scholars to do both test their theoretical assumptions and ensure at the same time, that no categories are overlooked.

This coding-scheme is then used to code statements that are the basic units of analysis in DNA. Statements are comprised of four variables [@Leifeld2018, 304-305]: actors, concepts, agreement, and time stamps. An actor is any person or organization that speaks in a debate. Concepts are political claims (henceforth claims) that either support or oppose policies, policy instruments, or certain actions in a policy process (see also @Lapesa2020, 144). Agreement refers to the extent of agreement or opposition of an actor towards a claim This variable can either be dichotomous (i.e., agree – 1 or disagree – 0) or lie within a certain range (e.g., from -5 to +5). Time stamp is a temporal variable that specifies the date and time of a statement and allows the construction of dynamic networks. So, for example, the statement of Prime Minister Tony Blair 'if Saddam [Hussein, FE] continues to fail to co-operate, force should be used', is coded as follows: 'T Blair' (= actor), 'Cabinet' (= organization), '22 – war' (= claim), 'yes' (= agreement), '18 March 2002' (= time stamp).

Unlike Foucauldian discourse analysis that ultimately seeks to unveil power relations, the overall aim of the second stage of DNA is to transform the generated data (i.e., the sum of coded statements) into a two-mode network (a bipartite graph), also known as an affiliation network of actors (or organizations) and claims (for the mathematical details of this transformation, see @Leifeld2019) that allows us to display the content, dynamic and drivers of political debates. In this affiliation network (see figure 1), every actor referring to a certain claim is displayed as an actor-node with an edge, linking the actor to the specific claim-node. This graph then allows us to gain insights into the content of the debate (the sum of claim-nodes) and who carries these claims (the actor nodes) [@Leifeld2018, 306].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "75%", fig.cap="Affiliation network with actors (a) agreeing to certain claims (c). The edgeweights (displayed by the line width) provide information about the extent of agreement towards claims."}

```

%![Figure 1: Affiliation network with actors (a) agreeing to certain claims (c). The edgeweights (displayed by the line width) provide information about the extent of agreement towards claims.](fig/fig1_affiliation-network-example.png)

In the next step, we are able to transform this two-mode affiliation network into a one-mode congruence (or conflict) network of actors or claims (see figure 2). This transformation assumes that networks are "belief similarity networks of actors" [@Leifeld2013, 170] in the sense that 'the more concepts [(i.e., claims), FE] two actors agree (or both disagree) on, the more similar they are in terms of preferences on concepts in the discourse' [@Leifeld2013, 174]. Hence, actor congruence networks are networks that link actors to each other by edges, whenever these actors share the same claim by either both agreeing or both disagreeing to it. Claim congruence networks, on the other hand, are networks that display the edges between claims, whenever actors refer to the same claim in the same direction (i.e., both agreeing or both disagreeing). The same logic applies to conflict networks that display actors or claims, where actors have different attitudes towards claims (e.g., one actor agrees to a claim, the other one disagrees). One can of course also combine both, concurrence and conflict networks, with the subtraction mode, where agreements and disagreements are added up. So, for example, when two actors agree to a claim two times, and one time they disagree to the same claim, the overall value of agreement is +1.

![Figure 2a: Actor-congruence network](fig/fig2a_congruence-network-example-a.png)

![Figure 2b: Claim-congruence network](fig/fig2b_congruence-network-example-b.png)

So consequently, the more often actors refer to the same claim, the larger the edge-weight between these actors become. Hence, the edge-weight becomes a measurement of similarity in the discourse [@Leifeld2013, 175]. To cope with the fact that some actors in a debate are supposed to speak more often than others (e.g., government officials receive more space in newspaper articles than ordinary citizens), we apply normalization [@Leifeld2013, 176; @Leifeld2018, 310-313; @Fisher2019, 476] to control for this phenomenon by setting the mentioning of claims by actors in relation to their overall possibilities to mention claims in the first place.

The time stamp variable of statements is useful to display dynamic networks (see figure 3). In this case, networks are drawn by grouping statements into certain time periods (e.g., statements of the same day, the same month, or the same year). "[M]odelling the development of political debates as dynamic networks may enable us to identify recurring mechanisms that drive the development of political debates" [@Haunss2020, 326]. Hence, dynamic networks are essential tools to understand the continuity and change of policies.

Finally, we can refer to various network measurements to better describe the characteristics of the overall discourse network and the discourse coalitions within it. Three of these measurements are especially helpful in the context of DNA: density, centrality, and various community detection algorithms. First, density describes the fraction of the maximum number of possible edges between nodes that is present in a network. By doing so, density gives an impression how connected nodes in a network really are [@Newman2010, 134–135]. The value for density ranges between 0 (there are no edges in a network, so that not a single node is linked to at least one other node) and 1 (the maximum number of edges is present because every node is connected to every other node). Thereby, density gives us information about the degree of interaction in a network. The higher the number of nodes and edges between these nodes in a network is, the more likely it is that a variety of claims and a greater number of actors support these claims in a debate.

Second, centrality measures give answers to the question which nodes are most important in a network, either because they have the most links to other nodes (degree centrality), are connected to other important nodes (eigenvector centrality), are closely linked to other nodes in terms of distance (closeness centrality), or because they are strategically situated between other nodes (betweenness centrality) and thereby have a high social capital and hence power [@Newman2010, 168–193]. These measurements allow us to detect the central carriers of a debate. These are the nodes that link different groups to each other and contribute to the establishment of a solid majority for the continuity or the change of an existing policy.

Third, community detection algorithms like modularity-maximization, hierarchical clustering, or betweenness-approaches, are concepts that group nodes into clusters or communities of like-minded nodes, because they share a higher number of similarities than other nodes [@Newman2010, 357-358 and 371-391]. These approaches, therefore, are the preferred measurements to group actors into discourse coalitions and to make them visible (see, for example, figure 4).

To summarize this section, DNA proceeds in two steps. First, the statements of actors are coded using qualitative content analysis and a deductively and/or inductively developed coding-scheme. Second, these statements are then used to build affiliation- and congruence-networks that allow us to gain more insights into the content, dynamic, and structure of the debate over time. By applying different sorts of network measurements, we are able to describe the characteristics of, and to detect powerful nodes in the network.
